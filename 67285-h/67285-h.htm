<p><span class="smcap">My Dear Boys</span>: This book is a complete
story in itself, but forms the seventh volume in
a line issued under the general title, “The Second
Rover Boys Series for Young Americans.”</p>

<p>As told in some volumes of the First Series,
this line of books was started years ago with the
publication of “The Rover Boys at School,” “On
the Ocean,” and “In the Jungle,” in which I introduced
my readers to Dick, Tom and Sam
Rover and their chums and relatives. The First
Series, consisting of twenty volumes, gave the
particulars of what happened to these three
Rover boys while attending Putnam Hall Military
Academy, Brill College, and while on numerous
outings in this country and abroad.
Having finished their education, the three young
men established themselves in business and became
married. Later Dick Rover was blessed
with a son and a daughter, as was also his brother
Sam, while the fun-loving Tom became the father
of a pair of lively twin boys.</p>

<p>From their homes in New York City the four
Rover boys were sent to a boarding school, as
related in the first volume of the Second Series,
entitled “The Rover Boys at Colby Hall,” where<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_iv"></a>[iv]</span>
they made many friends, also a few enemies.
From that school the scene was shifted to
“Snowshoe Island,” where the boys spent a winter
outing, and then they rejoined their fellow
cadets in some strenuous happenings while “Under
Canvas.” Then in “The Rover Boys on a
Hunt” they uncovered the mystery surrounding
a lonely house in the woods.</p>

<p>The older Rovers had become interested in
oil, and in the next volume, entitled “The Rover
Boys in the Land of Luck,” I related how the
lads went to Texas and Oklahoma. Then one
of their chums asked them to take a vacation
in the West, and in the volume preceding this
and called “At Big Horn Ranch” they had the
time of their lives.</p>

<p>In the present story the scene is shifted back
to Colby Hall and then to some rival camps on
the edge of a big lake. What happened to the
boys I will leave the pages which follow to relate.</p>

<p>As many of my readers know, the sale of this
line of books has now passed the <em>three million</em>
mark. To me this is as wonderful as it is pleasing.
I earnestly hope that the reading of these
volumes will do all of the boys and girls good.</p>

<p>Affectionately and sincerely yours,</p>

<p>“It’s great, I’ll say!” declared Randy Rover.</p>

<p>“I should say it was!” returned his twin
brother, Andy. “Just think of swooping through
the air like a bird! Gee, I’d like to own a flying
machine myself!”</p>

<p>“Well, our fathers owned one once,” declared
Captain Fred Rover, somewhat proudly. “They
flew clear to Brill College in their machine.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I’ve often heard them talk about that,”
put in Major Jack Rover. “They called the machine
the <i>Dartaway</i>. It was a biplane and of
rather primitive construction, because in those
days aeroplanes were a new invention and the best
of them were rather crude.”</p>

<p>“I wonder what ever became of that machine?”
questioned Andy.</p>

<p>“Oh, it went into the scrap heap long ago,”
declared his cousin Fred.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2"></a>[2]</span></p>

<p>“They didn’t have much use for it after they
left college and went into business in Wall
Street,” explained Jack. “But they certainly had
some dandy times in it.”</p>

<p>The four boys were out on Clearwater Lake
in one of the rowboats belonging to Colby Hall.
They had been watching the maneuvers of a
large biplane which had circled over their heads
several times. This biplane had made its headquarters
at a cove just below Haven Point, and
its owners had advertised far and wide to take
people up for a fly around the lake for fifteen
dollars per person. As this was the first aeroplane
to come to the lake for business, it had
taken up quite a few people during the past ten
days.</p>

<p>“I wonder how long they stay up on a trip,”
remarked Andy, as the four boys resumed their
rowing.</p>

<p>“The circulars say fifteen minutes,” answered
Fred.</p>

<p>“It didn’t seem to me he stayed up more
than ten minutes the time before this,” said Jack.
“I suppose they cut the time when they have other
people waiting to go up. They carry only two
passengers at a time, you know, and I suppose
they want to make hay while the sun shines.”</p>

<p>“A dollar a minute is making money pretty<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3"></a>[3]</span>
fast,” observed Randy. “I’d like to rake in an
iron man every sixty seconds by the watch,” and
he grinned.</p>

<p>“Yes, but it costs something to run a flying
machine,” returned Jack. “And then there is
the risk, too.”</p>

<p>“Well, if we went up it would cost the four
of us sixty dollars,” declared Randy.</p>

<p>“And I don’t see ourselves spending sixty dollars
that way just now,” cried Jack. “My spending
money for this quarter is getting low.”</p>

<p>“Don’t say a word, Jack, about spending
money!” came from his cousin Fred, with a wry
face. “I’m almost high and dry.”</p>

<p>“It’s lucky they can’t charge us for looking
at the aeroplane,” chuckled Andy.</p>

<p>The four Rover boys had left Colby Hall about
an hour before for a row down the Rick Rack
River to the lake. In a boat behind them were
four of their chums, Dick Powell, often called
Spouter because of his fondness for making long
speeches, Gif Garrison, who was at the head of
the school athletics, and Ned Lowe and Dan
Soppinger. Each crowd of cadets was in a well-built
four-oared boat, and a little while before
had indulged in a race which had come to an
end when all had stopped rowing to look at the
aeroplane which was soaring above their heads.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span></p>

<p>Boating that year promised to become popular
at Colby Hall. Colonel Colby had had the institution
fitted out with several new racing shells,
and in addition had purchased two motor-boats
of which all the cadets were very proud. A man
had been hired who knew all about motor-boats,
and he was instructing the various cadets in the
use of the craft.</p>

<p>“I must say I wish we were out in one of the
new motor-boats,” declared Fred, after they had
gone on rowing for ten minutes more. “This
is rather hot and tiresome work.”</p>

<p>“Never mind, Fred. You need the exercise,”
declared Jack. “You’re getting too stout. The
first thing you know you’ll be as fat as Fatty
Hendry.”</p>

<p>“Gosh! don’t say that, Jack,” returned the
young captain quickly. “Why, Fatty is so fat
he can hardly get through the dormitory doors!”</p>

<p>“That aviator won’t want to take up Fatty,”
remarked Andy. “That is, not unless he went
up alone and paid double fare.”</p>

<p>“Hi, you fellows, get a move on!” came a
shout from the other rowboat, and Gif Garrison
waved a hand towards the Rovers. “I thought
you were going to do a little rowing practice.
Remember, we have got to get busy if we want
to win any of those boat races later on.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span></p>

<p>“Fred and I are not in those races, Gif,” answered
Jack. “You know officers are not expected
to enter any contests like that.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but I expect Andy and Randy to go
into at least one race,” declared the cadet who
was at the head of the athletic committee.
“And when they go in I want them to make a
real showing for Colby.”</p>

<p>“We’ll do that all right enough,” declared
Randy.</p>

<p>“I’m going in for practice every day after
this,” answered his brother.</p>

<p>“Just remember we’ve got to wipe Longley
Academy from the face of the lake,” declared
Spouter Powell. “We’ll show them that as a
military academy they are not one, two, three
with good old Colby Hall.”</p>

<p>“That’s the talk!” cried Jack. “There’s going
to be only one real military academy around here,
and that’s Colby.”</p>

<p>“So say we all of us!” sang out his cousin
Andy.</p>

<p>“What did they want to turn Longley Academy
into a military school for, anyway?” grumbled
Ned Lowe. “I thought when they started
that school they were going to give their attention
mainly to athletics.”</p>

<p>“So they did,” answered Gif Garrison. “But<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
when they saw how popular Colby Hall was becoming,
and how they were losing one scholar
after another, I guess the owners got busy and
concluded the only thing they could do would
be to turn the academy into a military school and
give their boys the showiest kind of a uniform.”</p>

<p>“And they sure have got the uniforms!” declared
Fred, who overheard this remark from
the other boat. “Gosh! you would think they
were cadets from one of those little jerkwater
monarchies in Europe. Such gold braid and buttons
and such lace! It’s enough to make an
ordinary American boy sick!”</p>

<p>“You’d better not tell them that,” said Jack
quickly. “If you do they’ll say you’re jealous of
them because our uniforms are so ordinary.”</p>

<p>“Well, you give me the good old gray and
khaki every time,” came from Randy. “Both of
those colors stand the wear a good deal better
than that showy stuff will ever do.”</p>

<p>“Come on, fellows; jack her up!” called out
Gif. “I’ll bet you a pint of peanuts we can beat
you to the landing at Berry Island.”</p>

<p>“Make it a quart and we’ll go you!” shouted
back Jack gayly.</p>

<p>“And they’ve got to be freshly roasted, too,”
broke in Andy. “No stale old goobers from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
Rigoletto’s place where they’ve been lying in his
show window for a month or two! They’ve got
to be freshly roasted, right out of the whistling
roaster!”</p>

<p>“Get ready—pull!” cried Gif, a few seconds
later, and at this word of command from the
head of the general athletic committee the four
Rovers started up the lake with the other boat
close by their side.</p>

<p>It was a beautiful day in early summer, and
the surface of Clearwater Lake sparkled in the
sunshine. There was scarcely any wind and
consequently conditions were ideal for rowing.</p>

<p>Ever since they had come to the military academy
the four Rover boys had spent more or less
time on the river and the lake beyond, so they
were no novices when it came to handling an
oar. Jack set the pace, and his three cousins
kept stroke with him in a fashion that could not
help but win approval.</p>

<p>“Come on, fellows! We’ve got to beat ’em!”
cried Gif Garrison to his rowing mates. “Pull
now, and make every stroke tell!”</p>

<p>“We are not as well matched up as they are,”
panted Ned Lowe, who was by far the poorest
rower of the bunch. “Those Rovers have been
rowing together ever since they came to the Hall.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span></p>

<p>“Don’t growl, Ned! Row!” returned the
leader, and then the cadets in the second boat did
their best to outstrip their rivals.</p>

<p>It was certainly a spirited race and well worth
watching. But no other craft was in sight, the
two rowboats apparently having that portion of
the lake entirely to themselves. The aeroplane
which had attracted the rowers’ attention had
glided away in the distance and they could no
longer hear the roar of the motor.</p>

<p>Berry Island was little more than a quarter of
a mile away. It was for the most part very
rocky, but at one end there was a somewhat
sandy beach where the boys occasionally went in
bathing.</p>

<p>“Say, it wouldn’t be a bad stunt to go in swimming
after this race,” puffed Randy, as he bent
over his oar.</p>

<p>“No use to go in when you’re all tired out and
in a sweat,” declared Fred, who on account of
his stoutness found it rather difficult to keep up
with the others.</p>

<p>The Rovers had forged ahead, and it looked
very much as if they would win the race when
suddenly Randy began to drag. Then he lost his
stroke and that threw his brother out of stroke,
too, and this caused the rowboat to swerve from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
its course and the craft under Gif Garrison’s directions
shot ahead.</p>

<p>“Hi! what’s the matter with you?” cried Jack,
in some vexation.</p>

<p>“My oar caught on a rope or some bit of seaweed,”
declared Randy. “It’s gone now,” and
he and his brother proceeded to right themselves.
Then they caught the stroke and went forward as
before.</p>

<p>This little mishap occupied only a few seconds
of time, but during that period the other boat
went ahead a good hundred feet. Gif and his
followers were rowing with all their might, bound
to put all the distance possible between themselves
and their competitors.</p>

<p>“Swing into it! Swing!” cried Jack. “We’ve
got to catch up! Now then—all together and
make her jump out of the water!”</p>

<p>Jack had always been the leader of the four
cousins, and they obeyed his instructions as best
they could. They put in every ounce of their
strength on the oars, and slowly but surely their
craft began to overtake the other rowboat.</p>

<p>“Pull, you duffers, pull!” cried Gif, as he saw
the Rovers crawling up. “We’re almost to the
island! Pull, or they’ll overtake us!”</p>

<p>He increased the stroke and Spouter and Dan<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
followed. But this speed was too great for poor
Ned Lowe, and all of a sudden Ned’s oar came
up with a tremendous splash that showered everybody
in the boat with water. Then Ned lost his
balance and he and Spouter came close to falling
overboard. The craft slued around directly in
the path of the second rowboat.</p>

<p>“Stop rowing! Back water!” cried Jack, as
the sudden shouts ahead warned him that something
was wrong. He gave a quick glance
around, as did his oar mates, and then he and
Fred threw their craft out of the course. An instant
later the oars of the boats scraped each
other. But then the craft separated.</p>

<p>“Some narrow escape, I’ll say,” declared
Randy, when the momentary danger was over.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter with you fellows, anyway?”
called out Fred.</p>

<p>“Ned lost his stroke, that’s all,” answered Gif.</p>

<p>“Lost his stroke and gave us a shower bath at
the same time,” put in Dan.</p>

<p>“Well, I guess the race is off,” declared Jack,
good-naturedly. “Anyway, I think it’s about
time that we got back to the Hall. I want to
see Captain Dale before we have the evening
parade.”</p>

<p>“Let’s rest at the island just a few minutes,”
pleaded Randy. “I want to get my wind back<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
before—— Gee, boys, look at that, will you?”</p>

<p>He broke off suddenly and in his excitement
stood up in the rowboat pointing skyward as he
did so. All looked in the direction pointed out
and saw that the aeroplane was again heading in
their direction. But now instead of sailing along
on an even keel the flying craft was zigzagging
in a most unusual fashion.</p>

<p>“Say! there’s something wrong with that flying
machine, that’s sure,” declared Fred in excitement.</p>

<p>“Maybe the aviator is trying a few stunts,”
suggested Andy. “They do that once in a while,
you know.”</p>

<p>“But not when they have passengers who are
green at flying!” burst out Jack. “I believe something
is wrong with that machine.”</p>

<p>“Look! Look! Did you ever see anything
like that?” came from the other boat. “That
aviator acts as if he were crazy! Or otherwise
his machine has got the jimjams.”</p>

<p>By this time the aeroplane was almost over
their heads. The roar of the motor was deafening.
The great machine darted from one side to
the other, and then took a dip and a whirl which
made it look as if both rowboats and their occupants
might be doomed.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II<br />
<small>ABOUT THE ROVER BOYS</small></h2>
</div>


<p>“Look out!”</p>

<p>“We’re going to be smashed!”</p>

<p>“That fellow must be crazy!”</p>

<p>Such were some of the cries coming from the
Rover boys and their chums as the big aeroplane
swooped around from one side to another almost
over their heads.</p>

<p>It was a truly perilous moment, and no one
realized it more than did the Rovers. And what
to do not a one of them knew. To attempt to
row out of the way might prove the worst move
of all, for it might bring them directly to the
spot where the aeroplane would come crashing
down.</p>

<p>“Let’s dive overboard,” suggested Fred. “Go
down as deep as you can!” he yelled.</p>

<p>This seemed good advice and some of the lads
were on the point of following it when suddenly
the aeroplane made another swoop and struck the
surface of the lake some distance away. It sent<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
the water flying in every direction, some of the
drops even reaching the cadets. The propeller
gave a snap and one blade went whizzing up into
the sky to come down on the other side of Berry
Island. Then the flying machine began slowly
to settle and the motor stopped abruptly.</p>

<p>“Help! Help! Save us!” came in a girlish
voice across the water. “Save us!”</p>

<p>“Look! Look!” exclaimed Jack, springing
suddenly to his feet. “Unless I’m mistaken, that
is Ruth Stevenson!”</p>

<p>“It is Ruth, just as sure as you’re born!” declared
Fred. “And a man and the aviator are
with her!”</p>

<p>“That man must be her father,” went on Jack.
“She said he was going to call at Clearwater Hall
to see her. Come on, boys! We’ve got to get to
them before the aeroplane pulls them under.
Hurry! Row for all you’re worth!”</p>

<p>As he uttered the last words Jack sank down
on the seat and grasped tight hold of the oar
which had almost gotten away from him in his
excitement. The others also fell to rowing, and
away they pulled for the sinking aeroplane which
was less than two hundred feet away. Soon the
other rowboat followed.</p>

<p>And while the four Rover boys and their
chums are going to the rescue of those in peril,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
it may be as well for me to state as briefly as possible
who the boys were and how they came to
be in their present situation. Of course, those
who have read the previous volumes of this series
will need no special introduction to the Rovers,
and they can skip these pages if they so desire.</p>

<p>In the first volume of the line, entitled “The
Rover Boys at School,” I introduced three
brothers, Dick, Tom and Sam Rover and told
how they were sent to Putnam Hall Military
Academy where they had a number of adventures
and where they made great friends of three other
students, Larry Colby, Songbird Powell, and
Fred Garrison.</p>

<p>Passing from Putnam Hall, these three brothers
next attended Brill College, and then went into
business in New York City by organizing The
Rover Company with offices on Wall Street.</p>

<p>During their schoolboy days the three lads
had made the acquaintanceship of three nice girls,
Dora Stanhope and her cousins Nellie and Grace
Laning. Shortly after the three couples were
married and settled down in connecting houses on
Riverside Drive, New York City. As the result
of his marriage Dick Rover became the father
of a son, Jack, and a daughter named Martha.
Sam Rover was blessed with a girl called Mary,
and then a son who was christened Fred. At<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
about this same time Tom Rover’s wife, Nellie,
came forward with a lively pair of twin boys,
who were named Anderson and Randolph after
their grandfather and their great-uncle. Andy
and Randy, as they were always called, were full
of fun, coming naturally by this, as their father
had been as full of life as any lad could well be.</p>

<p>Being brought up side by side, the younger
generation of Rover boys, as well as the girls,
lived together very much as one large family.
But soon the boys began to cut up to such an
extent that it was decided to send them to some
strict boarding school.</p>

<p>About that time Larry Colby, the chum of the
older Rovers, had opened Colby Hall, a military
academy patterned somewhat after the national
institution at West Point. This was considered
just the institution for the younger generation,
and in the first volume the Second Series, entitled
“The Rover Boys at Colby Hall,” I related
how Jack, Fred and Andy and Randy journeyed
to that institution of learning and how they made
a number of warm friends and also defeated several
of their enemies.</p>

<p>The military school was located about half a
mile from Haven Point, a small town on Clearwater
Lake close to where the Rick Rack River
ran into that body of water. The school consisted<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
of a large stone building facing the river
and close by was a smaller building occupied by
Colonel Colby and his family and some of the
professors, and not far away were a gymnasium,
a boathouse, and several necessary buildings.</p>

<p>On arriving at Colby Hall the four Rovers
found several of their friends already there, including
Spouter Powell and Gif Garrison, the
sons of their fathers’ old classmates.</p>

<p>Up the lake on the other side of Haven Point
was located Clearwater Hall, a boarding school
for girls. During a panic in a moving picture
theater the four Rover boys became acquainted
with several girls from this school, including
Ruth Stevenson and May Powell, a cousin of
Spouter. Later on Mary and Martha Rover became
pupils at the girls’ school, and all of the
young folks got to be warm friends.</p>

<p>After a term at Colby Hall the four Rover boys
had the pleasure of spending the winter holidays
on “Snowshoe Island.” Then a little later they
went “Under Canvas” with their fellow cadets,
and later still went on a grand hunt, using a
bungalow up in the woods which belonged to
Gif Garrison’s uncle. This was during the great
World War and when the older Rovers had all
gone to France to fight for democracy.</p>

<p>The return of the older Rovers brought a surprise.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
Dick Rover had saved the life of a man
from Texas and in return had received a deed
to some land which later on was supposed to
contain oil. Dick decided to go to Texas and
Oklahoma, and the four boys begged to go with
him. And they had some stirring adventures in
what has so often been called “The Land of
Luck.”</p>

<p>After their adventures in the Southwest the
four boys returned again to Colby Hall. At
this time Jack was captain of Company C and
Fred was a lieutenant in the same command.</p>

<p>There was a spirited rivalry when a new election
for officers was held. But in spite of many
efforts made to defeat them, Jack was chosen
major of the school battalion and Fred was made
captain of Company C. Andy and Randy might
have held minor offices, but both preferred to remain
privates, especially as that would enable
them to take part in the various athletic exercises.
At first Colonel Colby had allowed the
cadets to join the baseball nine, football eleven,
and the rowing teams, even though they were officers.
But there had been some grumbling that
“some cadets were trying to do everything and
would not give the others a show,” and so it had
been decided that while all cadets were supposed
to go in for athletics in general, they could not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
be officers and take part in any official athletic
contests.</p>

<p>During this term at school Spouter asked the
Rovers and Gif Garrison to spend the summer
vacation with him out in Montana on a ranch
owned by his father. How the Rovers went out
there with their chums and what stirring times
they encountered have been related in the volume
preceding this, entitled “The Rover Boys at Big
Horn Ranch.” In that book they exposed the
acts of one of their enemies, Brassy Bangs, and
also brought a number of horse thieves to justice.</p>

<p>“We have certainly had some strenuous times
here,” remarked Jack, one day.</p>

<p>“I suppose it will be dead quiet for us this
winter when we return to Colby Hall,” his cousin
Randy had answered.</p>

<p>“Well, that will give us a chance to catch up
in our studies,” Fred had suggested. “We don’t
want to fall behind. If we do, our folks may
take us away from Colby Hall.”</p>

<p>“Oh, we don’t want to leave that place—at
least, not just yet!” Andy had put in hastily.</p>

<p>The winter had passed rather quietly, the boys
going home only for the Christmas holidays.
During that time there had come only one surprise,
and that was the news concerning Longley
Academy. This institution of learning, which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
had been in existence only a short time, had been
devoted very largely to physical culture and athletics
and had an extra fine baseball grounds with
a beautiful grandstand and bleachers. But
strange to say, the athletics had not been as prosperous
as the management of the institution
wished, and a good many of the pupils had been
on the point of leaving, and several had applied
for admission to Colby Hall.</p>

<p>As a consequence of this the owners of Longley
had turned the academy into a military school
with a section devoted to horsemanship. The
cadets were given a most striking uniform, and
everything possible was done to induce the cadets
of Colby Hall to shift to the other institution.</p>

<p>“And I call that about as mean a piece of business
as could happen,” was Jack’s comment, in
talking this over with some of his chums. “Of
course they have a perfect right to make a military
academy of Longley if they want to; but
they have no right to steal away our cadets.”</p>

<p>Among the boys to leave Colby Hall and go
to Longley were Paul Halliday and Billy Sands,
who had been great chums of Brassy Bangs while
that individual was a cadet. Of course, Colonel
Colby was sorry to have any of his pupils leave
him, but the Rovers were rather glad to see Halliday
and Sands go.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span></p>

<p>“It’s good riddance to those fellows!” Fred
had remarked. “I never considered either of
them much better than Brassy Bangs himself.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t think Halliday and Sands are
quite as bad as Bangs was,” Randy had answered.
“Still I’d rather have them somewhere else than
here.”</p>

<p>During the winter the cadets of Colby and the
boys at Longley had had several contests on the
ice and had also indulged in several snowball
fights. In one of these fights Fred had received
a black eye from a snowball hurled by Billy
Sands. In return for this Sands had been caught
a little later and rolled down into a snowy hollow,
much to his disgust. In one of the skating
races Paul Halliday had come in ahead of two
of the cadets from Colby, and because of this he
and the other cadets from Longley had done considerable
crowing.</p>

<p>“We’ll show Colby where they get off!” had
come boastfully from Tommy Flanders, a youth
who on several occasions had pitched for the rival
school.</p>

<p>“You’ll never show Colby anything!” Jack had
retorted, and this had made Tommy Flanders
very angry, because he had been virtually “batted
out of the box” by the Colby baseball nine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span></p>

<p>As a result of the new order of things a more
bitter rivalry than ever had sprung up between
Colby Hall and Longley Academy, and when the
winter was at an end and there were talks of
some boat races everybody was wondering how
the matches would terminate. The Colbyites
hoped that they might win, while the Longley
supporters went around everywhere declaring that
they “would wipe up the lake” with their rivals.</p>

<p>This was the condition of affairs when the four
Rovers had gone out on the afternoon of this
bright day in early summer for a row on Clearwater
Lake. They had been talking about the
boys at Longley Academy when their attention
had been attracted to the aeroplane, as mentioned
at the beginning of this story.</p>

<p>The flying machine was one belonging to an
aero corporation which sent aeroplanes to many
summer resorts where they might be used by
visitors and others. Each was supposed to be in
first-class condition and under the care of an experienced
aviator.</p>

<p>At first it was supposed that the aviator would
be able to get but little patronage at Haven Point
for the reason that the town was small and the
district sparsely settled. But it was soon found
that, by skillful advertising, the flying machine<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
drew a great many visitors to the lake; and
sometimes the aviator was called on to make a
dozen or more trips a day.</p>

<p>As he usually carried two passengers and as
the fare was fifteen dollars per person, it can
readily be seen that the business was a prosperous
one. The local paper had devoted several columns
to the enterprise, giving the personal experience
of a number of people who had made a
flight. So far nothing in the way of an accident
had occurred to mar the success of the undertaking.</p>

<p>But now in the twinkling of an eye all this
was changed. For some reason as yet unknown
the huge flying machine had struck the bosom of
the lake in slanting fashion and one of the blades
of the propeller had been broken of to fly into
space. And now the aeroplane was on the point
of sinking, carrying the aviator and his two passengers
with it.</p>

<small>THE RESCUE FROM THE BIPLANE</small></h2>
</div>


<p>“I wonder if they are strapped to the seats of
that biplane?”</p>

<p>“More than likely. They usually strap themselves
and their passengers fast to keep from falling
out.”</p>

<p>“If they can’t loosen the straps they’ll surely
be drowned.”</p>

<p>“Come on, fellows, row for all you’re worth!
A second gained may mean a life!” yelled Jack.</p>

<p>“Say, wasn’t that Ruth Stevenson?” came from
the second boat.</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Fred. “Hurry up! We’ve
got to save them!”</p>

<p>All this conversation came in jerks, for every
cadet was working frantically at his oar in a
mad endeavor to reach the sinking aeroplane.
They were almost up to the spot when they heard
a queer gurgle and suddenly the big flying machine
slid from view under the surface of the
lake.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span></p>

<p>“It’s going down!” cried Randy, glancing
hastily around.</p>

<p>By this time the first rowboat had reached
the scene of the accident and all of the boys threw
down their oars to get a better view of the situation.
The water was much disturbed, and in
the foam created by the disappearing flying machine
could be seen two men struggling, one with
some sort of strap fastened around him.</p>

<p>“Help! Help! I can’t swim!” cried one of the
men, and Jack recognized Mr. Stevenson’s voice.</p>

<p>“Help! I’m being pulled down! Help!”
gasped the aviator.</p>

<p>“Go after him, fellows! I’m going after Mr.
Stevenson!” called out Randy, and immediately
leaped overboard, followed by his brother.</p>

<p>“Where is Ruth?” questioned Jack anxiously,
for the girl from Clearwater Hall was one of
his dearest friends.</p>

<p>He had scarcely spoken when he saw an arm
appear a short distance away. Then Ruth’s head
bobbed up and the girl uttered another cry.</p>

<p>“Help me! I can’t move my feet! Help me!”</p>

<p>By this time the second boat was close at hand
and a glance showed Jack and Fred that the
aviator was already clambering on board. Another
glance showed Randy and Andy supporting
Mr. Stevenson.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span></p>

<p>“I’m coming, Ruth! Keep up!” cried Jack,
and leaping to the bow of the rowboat he made
a quick, slanting dive overboard which brought
him within a few feet of where the girl was
floundering. He knew that Ruth was a fair
swimmer and realized that something must be
radically wrong if she could not keep herself
afloat.</p>

<p>“Oh, Jack! Jack! Is that you?” gasped the
girl. “Help me! My feet are all tangled
up!”</p>

<p>“I’m coming, Ruth,” he reassured her. And
then he yelled back to his cousin: “Fred, bring
the boat up here, quick!”</p>

<p>The stout young Rover hastened to comply, and
while he was doing this Jack continued to swim
swiftly towards the hapless girl. He caught hold
of Ruth’s arm just as she was about to go down
a second time.</p>

<p>“Grab hold, Ruth. I’ll support you,” he said.
“What is holding you?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. A strap, I guess. I had one
around me and it loosened and slipped to my
knees.”</p>

<p>“Just hang over my shoulders and you’ll be all
right,” answered the young major. “I was afraid
you had been hurt.”</p>

<p>“But, Jack! I can’t move my feet at all!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span></p>

<p>“Never mind. We’ll soon have you on board
the boat.”</p>

<p>“Where is daddy?”</p>

<p>“Andy and Randy went for him. I’m sure
they’ll save him. We’ve got two boats here, and
four cadets in each; so there is plenty of assistance
at hand.”</p>

<p>At that instant Fred came alongside with the
boat and it was the work of but a few seconds to
place the dripping girl aboard. Then Jack followed.
As Ruth had said, a strap had become
tangled around her knees, but this was now disposed
of.</p>

<p>In the meantime Andy and Randy had reached
Mr. Stevenson, and with something of an effort
they managed to get that gentleman over
to the vicinity of the second boat. Ruth’s father
was somewhat excited, and this was but natural.
He could not swim, and, moreover, he had received
a blow in the side which pained him considerably.</p>

<p>“My daughter? Where is my daughter?” he
questioned as soon as he had hold of the side of
the boat.</p>

<p>“Jack and Fred went after her,” answered
Spouter. “There they are, over yonder. Jack is
supporting her.”</p>

<p>“Thank heaven then she isn’t drowned!” said<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
Mr. Stevenson, shuddering. “I’d have gone after
her myself; but what can a man do if he can’t
swim? After this I’ll advocate that every boy
and girl be forced to learn to swim,” he added,
with emphasis.</p>

<p>“Either that or keep away from the water,”
returned Andy grimly.</p>

<p>“Oh, Jack, what a terrible experience!” came
from Ruth, when she could regain her breath.
“I thought surely I was going down to the bottom
of the lake. And how good of you to come
to my aid!”</p>

<p>“You don’t suppose I was going to let you
drown, Ruth?” he answered quickly.</p>

<p>“I have to thank you too, Fred,” went on the
girl.</p>

<p>“Oh, I didn’t do so much,” answered the stout
Rover modestly. “It’s mighty lucky we happened
to be in this vicinity,” he went on.</p>

<p>“And just to think I was going to surprise you,
Jack!” continued Ruth.</p>

<p>“Surprise me?”</p>

<p>“Yes. By sending you a picture of daddy and
me in the aeroplane. You see, my father came
to Haven Point last night and called on me this
morning, and he happened to know the men who
are running the aero corporation. So when I
begged him to take me up he agreed and we had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
our photographs taken just when we started.”
She paused and gave a sudden shiver. “Oh, if
daddy had been drowned, what would I have
done!”</p>

<p>A little later the two boats came together and
Mr. Stevenson joined his daughter in the craft
manned by the Rovers.</p>

<p>“I scraped my side on the machine when we
came down so suddenly,” explained Ruth’s father.
“It hurts me yet. I think I’ll see a doctor about
it when I go ashore. I must have scraped the
skin pretty hard, if nothing more,” and he
winced.</p>

<p>“We’ll row for Haven Point right away,” answered
Jack.</p>

<p>“I suppose that’s the last of my biplane,” said
the aviator. “How deep is the lake around here,
do any of you know?”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe it’s very deep right here,” answered
Gif. “Do you see that sandy beach over
on the island yonder? Well, that sandbar extends
out in this direction.”</p>

<p>“Then maybe the machine didn’t sink as far
down as I thought it might,” went on Tom Bossick,
for such was his name. “I’d like to mark
this spot if I could.”</p>

<p>“Maybe you could dive overboard again and
find out what became of the flying machine,”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
suggested Dan Soppinger. “That is, unless you
feel too weak.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m all right. I went through a good
deal worse than this when I was flying for Uncle
Sam in France,” said Bossick, with a grin. “If
you fellows are not in a hurry I’d like to find
out what did become of the old lady.”</p>

<p>“If you fellows want to stay here with the aviator,
we’ll take Mr. Stevenson and Ruth over to
Haven Point,” said Jack.</p>

<p>“All right, go ahead,” answered Gif readily.
“We’ll take the aviator over later, after he has
located his machine. I suppose, if it’s only in
shallow water, it might be raised again?”</p>

<p>“So I was thinking,” answered Tom Bossick.</p>

<p>A minute later the two boats separated and the
four Rovers took up the task of rowing to Haven
Point.</p>

<p>“It’s mighty lucky for us that there’s no wind
and the sun is so warm,” said Jack, as he glanced
at the water still dripping from his own garments
and those worn by the others who had been in
the lake.</p>

<p>“We’ll create a sight when we reach the town,”
was Randy’s comment.</p>

<p>“I guess everybody will want to know what
happened to the flying machine and if the folks
on board were rescued,” put in Fred. “You<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
three will be regular heroes,” and he gave something
of an envious glance at his cousins.</p>

<p>“Oh, say, Fred! Can that hero stuff,” put in
Andy quickly. “Anybody would have done what
we did if only they had had the chance.”</p>

<p>“Nevertheless, I’m very thankful to all of you,”
said Mr. Stevenson.</p>

<p>“Are you sure you weren’t hurt quite a good
deal, Mr. Stevenson?” questioned Jack. He
noted that the face of Ruth’s father was pale
and haggard.</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t think it’s very much, Jack. Of
course, we came down so hard it gave us all a
terrible jolt.”</p>

<p>“It was like one of those roller-coaster boats
hitting the water at a seaside resort,” remarked
Randy.</p>

<p>“A good deal worse than that!” cried Ruth.
“You know, we came down nose first, as they
say. Why, for an instant I thought I was going
to be thrown out on my face. And, you must
remember, we were several hundred feet up in
the air when we started to fall.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I know you came down pretty hard,”
answered Andy. “Why, the water splashed in
every direction!”</p>

<p>After this there was a brief period of silence,
the boys bending vigorously to their oars, feeling<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
that the Stevensons would like to get ashore
and to shelter as soon as possible.</p>

<p>“I am staying at the Haven Point House,”
said Mr. Stevenson. “I’ll go right up there and
get an extra room for Ruth, and then we can
telephone to Clearwater Hall and have some of
the girls bring her some dry clothing. And I’ll
have a doctor look her over, as well as find out
what’s the matter with my side. I don’t think
it’s much, but I want him to make sure. I have
trouble enough these days without becoming
sick,” he added, with a thoughtful look on his
face.</p>

<p>As anticipated, their coming to one of the
docks of the town created not a little excitement.
A number of persons had seen the erratic movements
of the biplane and had witnessed its disappearance
into the lake, and the news had spread
that the aviator and his passengers were probably
drowned. Several boats had put out to the
scene of the disaster, but these now returned. A
crowd surrounded the Stevensons and the cadets,
asking numerous questions. But Jack soon obtained
a taxicab, and into this the Stevensons
were hurried and the driver was directed to take
them at once to the hotel.</p>

<p>“We’ll be up after a while,” said Jack. “I
want to telephone to Colonel Colby first, to let<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
him know we’ll be late in getting back. I don’t
want to leave here until I find out what condition
your father is really in.”</p>

<p>With the Stevensons gone, the Rover boys told
the crowd some of the particulars of what had
happened.</p>

<p>“I think I know what was the trouble,” said
another aviator who was present, a man who occasionally
took Tom Bossick’s place. “Tom and
I were going over the motor a couple of days
ago, and I noticed that it wasn’t as fast to the
framework as it might be. It’s my opinion it
worked loose, and that threw the machine off its
keel.”</p>

<p>“The aviator didn’t say what went wrong,”
answered Fred. “Perhaps he didn’t know himself.
But one thing is sure—the biplane bobbed
around from one side to the other several times
before it headed down into the lake.”</p>

<p>“Well, they can all be thankful they escaped
with their lives,” said one of the bystanders, and
in this statement everybody concurred.</p>

<p>The Rover boys telephoned to the military
academy and gave the head of that institution a
few of the particulars of what had occurred.
Colonel Colby had heard nothing about the aeroplane
accident, and was, of course, much surprised.
He readily gave the boys permission to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
remain in town for an hour longer in order that
they might ascertain more of Mr. Stevenson’s real
condition.</p>

<p>A motor boat had been sent to the scene of the
wreck, and this presently returned with Tom Bossick
on board.</p>

<p>“The cadets in the other rowboat have returned
to their school,” said the aviator. “We found
that the aeroplane was under less than twenty feet
of water, so I have hopes that we can raise her
and maybe have her repaired, or at least save the
engine. I think she rests on that sandbar one of
you young fellows mentioned.”</p>

<p>“And what went wrong?” questioned Fred
eagerly.</p>

<p>“I think the motor got loose somehow. We’ll
have to investigate after we raise the biplane—if
we ever do.”</p>

<p>A little later the four Rover boys went to the
hotel. There they encountered Jack’s sister Martha
and Fred’s sister Mary, who had just come
over from Clearwater Hall with some dry clothing
for Ruth. Of course the two Rover girls
were greatly excited, and they rushed at their
brothers and their cousins, demanding to know
if they were perfectly all right.</p>

<p>“Sure we are!” declared Fred. “Why, I
wasn’t even in the water!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span></p>

<p>“But the rest of you are dripping wet,” declared
Martha.</p>

<p>“We’re all right,” answered Jack. “But what
we want to know is how Mr. Stevenson and
Ruth are.”</p>

<p>“Ruth says the bath didn’t hurt her a bit,”
answered Mary. “But she is rather worried
about her father.”</p>

<p>A few minutes later Ruth came forth. Her
hair was still wet and done up fantastically in a
towel, but she wore the dry clothes the other
girls had brought her.</p>

<p>“I’m perfectly all right,” she said to Jack.</p>

<p>“What about your dad?”</p>

<p>“The doctor says he’ll have to keep very quiet
for a few days,” went on the girl soberly. “He
received a blow in the side just under the right
arm. He is all black and blue.”</p>

<p>“He seemed to be very haggard, Ruth,” remarked
the young major.</p>

<p>At this Ruth Stevenson gave Jack a look which
he found hard to interpret. She caught Jack’s
hand and drew him a little to one side.</p>

<p>“Dad has been having a whole lot of trouble
lately,” she whispered. “Some time I’ll tell you
all about it—or at least as much as I know of it.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV<br />
<small>A SUDDEN INTERRUPTION</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Quarter of an hour later found the four
Rover boys once more on the lake, this time bound
for Colby Hall. They had said good-by to Ruth.
Mary and Martha were to return by taxicab to
Clearwater Hall.</p>

<p>“You boys have got to be careful after this,”
said Jack’s sister. “Suppose that flying machine
had come down on top of you? You might all
have been killed!”</p>

<p>“Yes. But suppose we hadn’t been in that
vicinity when it did come down?” returned her
brother. “Ruth and all of them might have been
drowned!”</p>

<p>“I understand Colby Hall and Longley Academy
are going to have some boat races soon,”
said Mary to the twins. “Are you going to take
part?” She knew that, as officers, Jack and Fred
could not participate.</p>

<p>“Gif says he wants us in one of the races,”
answered Randy. “I certainly would like to put
one over on some of those Longley fellows.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span></p>

<p>“I heard one of the Longley cadets bragging
that the Colby Hall fellows were deserting as
fast as they could and coming over to Longley,”
broke in Martha.</p>

<p>“That isn’t true, Martha!” returned Andy.
“We’ve lost just five cadets all told, and two of
them were fellows we were glad to get rid of—Billy
Sands and Paul Halliday.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you mean the cadets who used to travel
with Brassy Bangs!”</p>

<p>“Yes. And let me tell you something—Longley
Academy has lost over fifteen pupils during
the past year; and of those, four are now enrolled
at Colby and three more are trying to get
in. So I guess all told we have the best of it.”</p>

<p>Jack had had no opportunity to ask Ruth the
particulars of her father’s trouble. But he had
promised to see the girl a few days later or call
her up on the telephone, and then, he knew, she
would give him more of the facts.</p>

<p>“Mr. Stevenson certainly looked very haggard,”
he mused to himself. “He certainly must
have something very serious on his mind. I hope
it isn’t something that will affect Ruth. It
would be too bad if he lost his money or something
like that and Ruth had to give up going
to Clearwater Hall.”</p>

<p>The strenuous happenings of the afternoon,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
along with the unexpected bath of Jack and the
twins, made the Rover boys rather weary, and so
they took their time at rowing up the lake to the
river.</p>

<p>“There is no use of our hurrying,” declared
Fred. “We won’t be in time for the evening
parade anyway. And Colonel Colby said we
could take our own time.”</p>

<p>“Just the same, I want to get there before the
mess hall is closed,” declared Andy. “I’m about
famished.”</p>

<p>“Don’t say a word about being hungry!” returned
his twin. “I wish we had bought some
doughnuts, or something like that, before we
left town.”</p>

<p>“I’m sure Captain Dale will allow us something
to eat even if the mess hall is closed,” declared
Jack. Captain Dale was one of their
military instructors and the official who took
charge of the academy during Colonel Colby’s
absence.</p>

<p>The summer day was drawing to a close and
the sun was setting behind the hills to the west
of Haven Point when the tired cadets reached
the mouth of the Rick Rack River. Here there
was a small island in the middle of the stream
dividing that waterway into two rather narrow
channels.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span></p>

<p>“Here comes a motor-boat!” exclaimed Fred
presently, pointing up the river. “I wonder if
it’s one of our boats coming to meet us.”</p>

<p>“I hope it is,” returned Randy. “I’d much
rather be towed back than do more rowing.”</p>

<p>“It isn’t one of our boats,” said Jack, a few
seconds later. “Our boats are all striped white
and blue. This one is green and yellow.”</p>

<p>“Green and yellow!” exclaimed Andy. “Why,
that’s the color of some of the Longley boats!
To my mind they are the ugliest things on the
lake.”</p>

<p>It was indeed a motor-boat belonging to Longley
Academy, and as it came closer the Rovers
noted that it contained four cadets, two in khaki
outing uniforms and the other two in the brilliant
uniforms used by the Longley cadets when
on parade.</p>

<p>“Gee! how those fellows do love to show off
those uniforms,” remarked Fred.</p>

<p>“Maybe that’s the only suit of clothes they
have to their backs,” chuckled Andy.</p>

<p>The motor-boat coming down the river occupied
the middle of the stream. As it reached
the vicinity of the little island just mentioned it
should have turned to the other channel from
that being used by the Rover boys. Instead,
however, it came rushing straight towards them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span></p>

<p>“Hi, you! Get out of the way there! Look
where you’re running!” exclaimed Jack, in alarm.</p>

<p>“Ha-ha! Don’t get scared,” sang out a youth
at the wheel of the motor-boat. “We won’t run
you down.”</p>

<p>By this time the motor-boat was directly alongside
of the rowboat. It came so close that the
oars on that side scraped the hull of the heavier
craft. There was a tremendous swell from the
propeller, and the next instant a small wave hit
the gunwale and dashed over the Rover boys’
feet. The rowboat bobbed up and down in the
narrow channel like a cork, the water foaming
and churning all around it. In the meanwhile
the motor-boat darted ahead and was soon out
on the broad bosom of Clearwater Lake.</p>

<p>“Well, of all the gall!” burst out Andy, as
soon as he could recover from his astonishment.</p>

<p>“They did that on purpose!” burst out Jack.
“Did you see who was at the wheel?”</p>

<p>“It was Tommy Flanders!” cried Randy.</p>

<p>“He’s sore over the way he was batted out of
the box in those baseball games,” remarked Fred.
“Just the same, he had no business to endanger
our lives in this narrow passage. I wish we
could get hold of him,” and he shook his head
angrily.</p>

<p>“We can’t follow a motor-boat in a rowboat,”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
answered Jack. “Just the same, we ought to let
him hear from us about this.”</p>

<p>“If we only had one of our own new motor-boats,”
groaned Fred, “I bet we could catch that
old tub!”</p>

<p>“Did you notice who the fellows in the gaudy
uniforms were?” questioned Andy. “Our beloved
friends, Halliday and Sands!”</p>

<p>“Yes, I noticed that,” returned Jack. “They
must be so stuck on those new gaudy uniforms
they can’t bear to go out without them. Who
was the fourth fellow?”</p>

<p>No one could answer that question, and after
gazing at the motor-boat until it was almost lost
in the distance the Rover boys resumed their rowing
and presently reached the military academy
dock. A crowd was there to meet them, for Gif
and the other cadets had spread the news of what
had happened out on the lake.</p>

<p>“Here come the real heroes!” cried Gif good-naturedly.
“Here are the ones who did the real
rescue act!”</p>

<p>“Cut it out, Gif!” returned Jack. “What we
want is to get into some dry clothing and get
something to eat.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and after that we’ve got something to
tell you about Tommy Flanders and Sands and
Halliday,” added Randy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span></p>

<p>The four boys hastened to report to Captain
Dale and then hurried up to the rooms they occupied.
They had four rooms in a row on the
second floor. Jack occupied a small one and
Fred another, while a third was used by the twins.
The fourth room was a general sitting room and
a place for study. This had been a meeting place
many times for the Rover boys and their chums.</p>

<p>It did not take Jack and the twins long to
change their clothing nor Fred to brush up a
bit. This done, all hurried down to the mess
room, a corner of which had been kept open for
them. They found both Colonel Colby and Captain
Dale on hand, anxious to learn a few particulars
concerning the accident on the lake.</p>

<p>“It was a fortunate thing that you were on
hand to aid those in the flying machine,” remarked
the master of the school, when he had heard their
story. “I trust Mr. Stevenson is not seriously
hurt.”</p>

<p>After the meal the Rovers retired to their
rooms and were there joined by Gif and Spouter.
To their chums they related what had occurred
at the entrance to the river.</p>

<p>“That’s just like Flanders,” remarked Gif, in
disgust. “He always was the most overbearing
fellow I ever met.”</p>

<p>“Well, I can’t say quite as much as that,” answered<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
Jack. “You mustn’t forget Gabe Werner
and Slugger Brown,” he added, mentioning the
names of two school bullies who for various reasons
had had to leave the military academy.</p>

<p>“Yes, and don’t forget Bill Glutts, Werner’s
crony,” put in Fred. “How I used to despise
that butcher boy!”</p>

<p>“Now he has made something of a fizzle of his
pitching, I understand Flanders is going in for
rowing this summer,” came from Spouter.</p>

<p>“Well, if he makes as much of a failure of his
rowing as he did of his pitching he won’t amount
to a great deal,” was Andy’s comment.</p>

<p>“Don’t be so sure of that, Andy,” returned
Jack. “Flanders wasn’t a half-bad pitcher. The
only trouble with him was that when he got into
a real tight place he was apt to lose his head.
If he could have kept cool, he would have been
one of the best pitchers in these parts.”</p>

<p>“We ought to get square with him for almost
running us down,” came from Fred. “Gee!
that big motor-boat might have cut us right in
two!”</p>

<p>“It’s too bad he didn’t run her on the rocks
in that channel,” was Randy’s comment.</p>

<p>“We’ll get square with Flanders some day.
Just wait and see!” declared the young major.</p>

<p>The boys continued the discussion for a quarter<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
of an hour longer, and then the Rovers intimated
that they would have to get at some of
their studies for the next day. Taking this hint,
Gif and Spouter took their departure.</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t interfere with your learning for
the world,” said Spouter softly, as he stood in
the doorway. “Learning is the very foundation
of all knowledge. Were it not for learning, man
would still be in the primitive state of a savage.
Were it not for learning, man would still be
groping in darkness wondering whither he was
going and what his existence really meant. Were
it not for learning, such a noble institution as
Colby Hall would not exist. Were it not for
learning—wow!”</p>

<p>Spouter’s flowery oration came to a sudden
termination as Andy threw a book which took
the tall youth directly in the stomach. Picking
the book up from the floor, Spouter hurled it at
the fun-loving Rover’s head and then fled precipitately
down the corridor with Gif laughingly following
him.</p>

<p>“Why don’t you give Spouter a chance?” said
Jack to his cousin. “For all you know, he may
not have had a chance to talk to any one all day.”</p>

<p>“Give him a chance!” snorted Andy. “Not
when he goes off in that style! Why, when
Spouter gets a spouting streak on him, he’s like<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
a regular cataract, a cyclone and a tornado rolled
in one. You’ve got to cut him off at the beginning
or you can’t hold him in,” and at this rather
mixed-up explanation all the others laughed.</p>

<p>A few minutes later the four Rover boys were
deep in their studies. Jack had an essay to write
on “Great Discoverers” and Fred an essay on
“The Wonders of the Sky,” while the twins had
to wrestle with several problems in geometry.
All were seated in their sitting room, as they
termed it, with heads bent somewhat closely together
over a round center table.</p>

<p>“Say, Jack, how do you spell Jupiter?” questioned
the stoutest Rover boy. “Is it Ju-p-e- or
Ju-p-i-?”</p>

<p>“What kind of Jew is that you’re talking
about?” put in Andy slyly, looking up with a
pencil at his grinning lips.</p>

<p>“It’s J-u-p-i-t-e-r,” declared Jack.</p>

<p>“What in Jupiter are you writing about now,
Fred?” questioned Randy.</p>

<p>“‘Wonders of the Sky,’” answered his cousin.
“If I don’t have this essay done by noon to-morrow
I’ll be sure to get into hot water with
Professor Duke.”</p>

<p>“I’ve got to hand in my essay by ten o’clock,”
put in the young major. “We’d all better be getting
on the job—it’s getting late.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span></p>

<p>After that there was silence for several minutes.
Almost unconsciously the four boys heard
a slight noise in the corridor. But to this they
paid no attention, for cadets were continually going
or coming in one direction or another. Then,
of a sudden, came a most unexpected interruption.
The door which had been left unlocked was
suddenly opened and a masked figure appeared
holding in one hand a well-filled paper bag. The
next instant the paper bag was hurled through
the air, landing directly on the center of the table.
Then the door banged shut, hiding the masked
figure from view.</p>

<p>But the Rover boys could not have seen the
figure even if the door had been left open. As
the paper bag crashed down on the table it flew
apart and the next instant the four Rover boys
found themselves covered with black soot from
head to foot.</p>

<small>WHO WAS GUILTY?</small></h2>
</div>


<p>“For the love of molasses!”</p>

<p>“Who—threw—that—stuff—in?” came in a
splutter from Andy, who had received a large
dose of the soot in his nose and mouth.</p>

<p>“Ker choo! Ker choo!” was the only sound
made by his brother, on whom the soot acted like
snuff.</p>

<p>“Did you ever see anything like it?” burst out
Jack, trying to wipe the soot from his eyes with
a handkerchief.</p>

<p>“Who played that dirty trick?” questioned
Fred, who had been the first to speak.</p>

<p>“Some joke, I’ll say!” muttered the young
major of the Colby Hall battalion.</p>

<p>“Better say ‘choke,’” sputtered Andy. Then,
as he looked at his brother and his cousins, he
burst into a fit of laughter, and in this his twin
joined.</p>

<p>“We look like a lot of Negro minstrels, don’t
we?” was Fred’s comment. “Gee, what a mess!”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
he added, as he surveyed the table with its books
and papers. “I guess my essay is spoiled.”</p>

<p>“Mine ditto,” responded Jack. “And I was
writing it out so carefully, too,” he added mournfully.</p>

<p>Randy was the first to step to the door and
open it. He looked up and down the corridor,
but saw no one. However, a few seconds later
two cadets put in appearance. They were Fatty
Hendry and Phil Franklin, the latter a lad who
had become a warm friend of the Rovers through
a thrilling rescue on the Rick Rack River and
later by sharing many perils in Oklahoma and
Texas.</p>

<p>“Hello, there! what’s the idea?” exclaimed Phil
Franklin, as he came to a halt and gazed at Randy
in amazement.</p>

<p>“Are you getting ready for a masquerade?”
questioned Fatty Hendry. “I didn’t know there
was anything of that sort going on to-night.”</p>

<p>By this time the other Rovers had come to the
doorway, and the two new arrivals gazed at them
in added amazement. Then their eyes drifted to
the center table and took in the wreckage there.</p>

<p>“Hannibal’s ghost!” ejaculated the fat boy of
the school. “What’s this? It looks like lampblack.”</p>

<p>“It’s soot! Plain chimney soot!” answered<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
Jack, who by this time had partly cleared his
eyes. “Some fellow was mean enough just now
to open our door and throw that bag in on the
table where we were all writing and studying.”</p>

<p>“You don’t say so!”</p>

<p>“Some mean trick, I’ll say!” declared Phil
Franklin, his eyes flashing. He stepped into the
room. “An awful mess, eh? Your books and
papers will be about ruined,” he added. “Ink with
it, too!”</p>

<p>“The bag struck my inkwell and knocked it
over,” answered Fred. “It certainly is a mess. I
wish I knew who did it.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t you see the fellow at all?” questioned
Fatty.</p>

<p>“I just caught a glimpse of him,” answered
Randy. “He was in uniform and had a pillowcase
or something of the sort pulled over his head
and neck so that I couldn’t recognize him.”</p>

<p>“Must have been one of your old enemies,”
commented Phil.</p>

<p>“I thought all of our enemies were gone,”
answered Jack, who was still dabbing away at his
eyes with tears running down his cheeks. “Slugger
Brown, Nappy Martell, Gabe Werner and Bill
Glutts all got out some time ago; and now Brassy
Bangs, Paul Halliday, and Billy Sands are gone
too. I’m sure I don’t know who can be left.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span></p>

<p>“You don’t suppose it could be any of the
fellows who wanted to be major of the battalion,
do you?” asked Fatty.</p>

<p>“Or who wanted to be captain in place of
Fred,” added Phil.</p>

<p>“No, I don’t believe any of those fellows would
be mean enough to do this. They’ve all acted
pretty nice since the election,” answered Jack.
“It must have been someone else.”</p>

<p>“Going to report it?” came from the stout cadet.</p>

<p>“I don’t think so, Fatty,” said the young major
slowly. “In the first place, we don’t know who
is guilty. And in the second place, I have no
desire to become a telltale.”</p>

<p>“We’ll fight this out ourselves! You just
leave it to us!” broke in Andy. “The secret will
come out sooner or later.”</p>

<p>“I think the best thing we can do first of all
is to clean up this mess and then wash up,” said
Fred. “Gee! I hardly know how to begin,” he
added, gazing at the disordered center table ruefully.</p>

<p>“Here’s an old brush and an empty shoebox,”
returned Jack. “We’ll brush the soot into the box
as carefully as we can. We don’t want any more
of it to be flying around. As it is, this room will
have to be dusted and cleaned up thoroughly.”</p>

<p>“Well, if we can’t help you we might as well<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
be on our way,” said Fatty Hendry. “I have
some boning to do before I hit the hay.”</p>

<p>“And I’ve got some problems in algebra to
solve,” came from Phil.</p>

<p>“I don’t see how you can help us unless you
can find out who that masked cadet was,”
answered Jack.</p>

<p>“Listen!” put in Fred quickly. “If it’s just
the same to you fellows, keep this to yourselves,
will you?”</p>

<p>“Sure!” answered Phil. “I won’t say a word
if you don’t want me to.” And to this Fatty also
agreed.</p>

<p>The soot had certainly made a great mess, and
it took the Rover boys the best part of half an
hour to put the room in order. Luckily, their
school books were not damaged quite as much as
they had at first supposed, and by dusting them
off with care they made the volumes fairly presentable.
The essay papers, however, were
spoiled, and both Jack and Fred decided they
would have to be written over again.</p>

<p>“I’m going to get up real early to-morrow
morning and do it,” said Jack, and his cousin
agreed to do the same.</p>

<p>Then the boys brushed their uniforms as best
they could, and after that each took a bath, which
made them feel better.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span></p>

<p>“I’m going to snoop around a little and see if
I can get on the track of the rascal who played
this trick,” announced Randy, after he had
donned clean clothing.</p>

<p>“And I’ll go with you,” answered his brother.</p>

<p>It still lacked half an hour of time to retire,
and the others availed themselves of this to start
the new copies of their essays. Just as the “lights
out” bell was ringing the twins came in
again.</p>

<p>“Nothing doing,” announced Andy, with a disappointed
look on his otherwise cheerful face.
“All of the cadets look as meek as lambs.”</p>

<p>“Couldn’t spot a single soul who might have
done it,” added his brother. “But we’ll get on
to it sooner or later, you just watch me!” he
continued determinedly.</p>

<p>True to their resolve, Jack and Fred were up
a little after five in the morning and hard at work
on their essays.</p>

<p>“We’ve got to make a good showing, Fred,”
remarked the young major, “not only because
we’re officers of the battalion, but because the
folks at home expect it.”</p>

<p>“Just the same, I’ll be glad when vacation comes
around,” remarked the younger Rover.</p>

<p>“Wonder what we can do this summer.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. I suppose the folks are planning<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
to send us up to Valley Brook farm—at least
for a few weeks.”</p>

<p>“Well, I wouldn’t mind seeing old Aunt Martha
and Uncle Randolph, not to say anything about
Jack Ness,” was the reply. “But I wouldn’t like
to stay on the farm too long. It gets monotonous.”</p>

<p>“Gee, if we could only go to some such place
as Big Horn Ranch or Snowshoe Island!”</p>

<p>“Now you’re talking! Well, something may
turn up before the school closes; who knows?”</p>

<p>Presently the gong sounded for the cadets to
assemble on the parade ground in front of the
school building. At once the two young officers
donned their coats and their swords and lost no
time in hurrying below, followed presently by the
twins, who had to go to the racks in the lower hall
for their firearms.</p>

<p>Five minutes later another gong sounded, and
by this time all of the cadets, except one or two
who had been excused, were assembled on the
parade ground. Major Jack was at the head of
the battalion, which consisted of three companies,
and beside him stood Captain Dale, who usually
was present to witness the conduct of the cadets.</p>

<p>“Battalion, attention!” commanded the youthful
major, and at once the cadets of the three companies<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>
braced up and stood in long rows like so
many ramrods.</p>

<p>“Present arms!” was the next command, and
thereafter Jack put the battalion through the
manual of arms. At the conclusion he looked inquiringly
at Captain Dale.</p>

<p>“Very good, Major Rover,” said the military
instructor. “Very good, indeed.”</p>

<p>After this came a slight pause, and then came
another command.</p>

<p>“Battalion, attention! Forward, march!”</p>

<p>Boom! Boom! Boom, boom, boom! sounded
out the drums, and then came a rattle and the
shrill notes of the fifes and away marched the
cadets, to circle the Hall and then enter the building.
Here the guns and swords were discarded
and the boys poured into the big mess hall, there
to seat themselves at the long tables provided, each
in his accustomed place. Then, after a blessing
asked by one of the professors, they all fell to
eating with great gusto.</p>

<p>Jack did his best that day to settle his mind
on his studies, yet many times he found himself
thinking of Ruth and her father and wondering
what was the trouble that had come to Mr.
Stevenson.</p>

<p>“It must be something out of the ordinary,”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
mused the young major. “Otherwise, Ruth
wouldn’t have bothered to mention it. It’s too
bad—and just when her father is under the
weather, too!”</p>

<p>Of course, the Rovers and the others who had
been out on the lake when the biplane crashed
down were asked innumerable questions by their
friends, and they had to tell the particulars of the
mishap over and over again. Those who had gone
overboard were asked if they had suffered anything
from the sudden plunge.</p>

<p>“Not at all,” answered Randy. “It was just
like taking a bath before Saturday night comes
around, you know,” and at this some of the cadets
who were listening grinned.</p>

<p>Among the boys to listen to an account of what
the Rovers and their chums had to relate was
Henry Stowell, a lanky young cadet who, because
of the peculiar broad mouth he possessed, often
went by the nickname of Codfish. Stowell was a
regular sneak, and had often been a toady of some
of the bullies who had from time to time been
cadets at the Hall. He was thoroughly disliked
by a large number of the pupils. On more than
one occasion the Rovers had done Codfish favors,
and twice they had rescued him from those who
would do the cadet harm. But though Stowell had
promised to mend his ways, he had soon slumped<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
in his habits and become just as much of a sneak
and a telltale as ever.</p>

<p>“Those people ought to give you a big reward
for saving their lives,” said Stowell. “They ought
not to expect you to do that for nothing.”</p>

<p>“We weren’t out for any reward, Codfish,”
answered Randy promptly.</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s all right,” said the sneak, pulling
down the corners of his broad mouth. “Just the
same, a reward comes in mighty handy, especially
when a fellow’s pocket money is getting low.”
Stowell’s allowance was small, and it was a notorious
fact among those who knew him best that he
was continually borrowing from those more fortunate
than himself.</p>

<p>“That sneak makes me sick,” declared Andy,
when he and his brother were by themselves. “I
suppose if he had been there he would have said,
‘Give me ten dollars or I won’t haul you out of
the lake!’”</p>

<p>“He certainly is a poor stick; and all of the
lessons we’ve given him haven’t improved him
any, so far as I can see,” answered Randy.</p>

<p>It was not until three days later that the Rovers
had a chance to go over to Clearwater Hall. In
the meantime, however, the young major had
taken it upon himself to call up his sister on the
telephone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span></p>

<p>From Martha he learned that Mr. Stevenson
had gone home. His side was still very sore and
Jack’s sister said that he looked more haggard
than ever.</p>

<p>“I think he has something on his mind,” Martha
said, over the wire. “But what it is I, of course,
don’t know. Nor did I care to question Ruth.
Perhaps she will tell you something about it herself.”</p>

<p>Because of this, Jack was quite concerned when
he and his four cousins got a chance to ride down
to Haven Point in one of the school automobiles.
The chauffeur of the car, Bob Nixon, said he was
going to stay in town two hours, which would
give the boys a chance to run up to the girls’
school and see their relatives and friends.</p>

<p>As a usual thing, outsiders were not permitted
at Clearwater Hall except upon special occasions.
But there was an understanding between Colonel
Colby and Miss Garwood, the head of the girls’
school, whereby the Rovers could visit their relatives
almost any time. And this, of course,
usually gave them a chance to see Ruth Stevenson
and May Powell, Spouter’s cousin. Spouter
often came also, bringing Gif with him.</p>

<p>The young folks met in the lower hall of the
institution and then strolled out under the big
trees of the campus. They talked about matters<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>
in general and also about Mr. Stevenson’s condition.</p>

<p>“I think he’ll get over his injuries in a week
or two,” declared Ruth. “He certainly got
bumped most dreadfully.”</p>

<p>Presently, as had happened before, Jack and
Ruth walked off a little by themselves, and then
the young major questioned the girl regarding
her father’s troubles.</p>

<p>“Of course you haven’t got to say anything
if you don’t want to, Ruth,” he added. “But
if there is anything I could do to help I’d like
to know it.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know how you can help us, Jack,”
answered the girl soberly. “But daddy certainly
has trouble—and of a most unexpected sort.”</p>

<p>“Something to do with his business, I suppose?”</p>

<p>“Yes and no, Jack. He has had a very valuable
book of formulas stolen,” answered the
girl.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI<br />
<small>WHAT HAPPENED IN THE STORM</small></h2>
</div>


<p>“A book of formulas?” repeated the young
major of the Colby Hall battalion. “Just what
do you mean by that, Ruth?”</p>

<p>“It’s rather a long story, Jack, and I don’t
know all of the particulars. But it seems that
during the great World War two Germans,
brothers, came to this country, bringing with
them some formulas for making artists’ paints.
They had been in the business both in Germany
and in France and could produce most wonderful
shadings in these artists’ materials.”</p>

<p>“I see, Ruth. I know the Germans were always
great on formulas of dyes and things like
that.”</p>

<p>“Well, these two Germans were very old men,
and in a roundabout way they offered to sell
these formulas, for they felt that they were too
old to go into the manufacture of such things.</p>

<p>“Now, my father, as perhaps you know, has
been interested for several years in a small paint
works located in the Middle West. Through the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
manager of these paint works he was introduced
to the two old Germans who came East to see
him and finally offered him these wonderful
formulas, provided he would keep the entire matter
secret.</p>

<p>“They proved to his satisfaction that they
owned all rights to the preparations, and offered
to sell said rights for the sum of thirty thousand
dollars.”</p>

<p>“Thirty thousand dollars!” exclaimed Jack.
“Some little sum of money, I’ll say!”</p>

<p>“My father didn’t have so much cash, but he
borrowed some from a bank and got some more
from old Uncle Barney, who was making money
out of those zinc ore beds on Snowshoe Island.
Together they went in and bought the formulas,
which were written out in detail in a leather-bound
notebook. They had originally been written
in German and in French, but were translated
by one of the old Germans into English.”</p>

<p>“And after your father had purchased this book
of formulas it was stolen from him?”</p>

<p>“Yes. He brought it home with him and
would have placed it in a safe deposit vault, but
took it home for the purpose of making a duplicate
copy. Of course, he didn’t want to trust
any outsiders with the secret just yet; so he
started in to make the copy himself.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span></p>

<p>“Then the book was stolen?”</p>

<p>“Exactly! It disappeared one night. He had
left it locked up in his desk, and when he went
for it the next day he found that his desk had
been broken open and that the valuable book of
formulas had disappeared.”</p>

<p>“What of the copy he had been making?”</p>

<p>“That had disappeared also.”</p>

<p>“Gracious! No wonder he was upset, Ruth.
Thirty thousand dollars is no mean price to pay
for a thing and then have it stolen. Did he suspect
anybody?”</p>

<p>“There was nobody to suspect. Our maid had
left our employ about a week before and gone to
live with a family in Philadelphia. There was
nobody at home but my mother and my father,
for mother had not yet succeeded in getting another
maid.”</p>

<p>“But wasn’t there any trace of the thief?”</p>

<p>“They found that a window of the library had
been broken open; but that was all. Nothing was
disturbed in the house except the desk. That was
of the regular roller-top variety and of course
could be broken open with ease.”</p>

<p>“The thief or thieves must have been watching
your father while he was using the book.
Otherwise they wouldn’t have been so certain
where it could be found.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span></p>

<p>“That is what daddy thinks. While he was
making his copy he sat under the light with the
curtains of the windows only partly drawn.
Anybody outside could have looked in.”</p>

<p>“Did your father suspect the two old Germans?”</p>

<p>“Not at all. They were nowhere near. Both
of them had gone to live with relatives out in
Milwaukee. He at once telegraphed to them,
telling of the loss and asking if they had duplicate
copies of the formulas. They at once sent a
night letter stating they had no duplicates, and
advising him to be on the lookout for two men
named Norris and Lemrech. Later my father
received a letter in which the old Germans told
about two workmen who had tried their best to
get the formulas away from them. These workmen
were Carl Lemrech and Tex Norris, his
American cousin. They said that Lemrech was
of a shady reputation, and not above stealing the
formulas, and that evidently his American cousin
was the same stripe of man.”</p>

<p>“Has your father been able to get on the trail
of those two men?”</p>

<p>“No. He hired a detective to follow them up,
but they had left the boarding house where they
had been staying for some time and had disappeared.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span></p>

<p>“Then it is this that is making your father look
so haggard, Ruth!”</p>

<p>“Yes. Because as soon as he obtained the
formulas and was satisfied that they were really
as valuable as anticipated, he took some more
money belonging to himself and to my Uncle
Barney and purchased a factory in which to manufacture
these artists’ colors. He had samples of
the colors, and, oh, Jack, you never saw such
beautiful greens and reds and blues in all your
life! They were simply wonderful! I’m sure
artists would go crazy over them!”</p>

<p>“I suppose your father is at a standstill in the
case then.”</p>

<p>“Absolutely. If something doesn’t turn up
soon I don’t know what he will do.”</p>

<p>“Has he told your Uncle Barney about this
loss?”</p>

<p>“Yes. He sent word the day after the flying
machine accident.”</p>

<p>“What has your Uncle Barney to say about it?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. I haven’t heard from him.
But I suppose he’ll be just as much upset as daddy.
I think he put every cent he had got out of the
zinc mines into this new concern.”</p>

<p>“It’s too bad, Ruth. I wish I could help you.
If only a fellow could get on the trail of this
Lemrech and his cousin Norris! Does your<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span>
father suppose they will be able to use the
formulas?”</p>

<p>“More than likely. You see, the whole affair
was conducted more or less in secret. That being
the fact, what is to prevent those two rascals
from selling the formulas to some other color
maker?” answered the girl somewhat sadly.</p>

<p>A few minutes later the two rejoined the others.
Andy was cutting up and telling some of his queer
jokes, and he had the girls shrieking with
laughter.</p>

<p>“And that puts me in mind of another!” Jack
heard his fun-loving cousin exclaim. “When is
an apple pie more than an apple pie?”</p>

<p>“Oh, Andy! how can an apple pie be more
than just an apple pie?” murmured May Powell.</p>

<p>“Isn’t it more of an apple pie when it’s a peach
of an apple pie?” retorted Andy. And then May
made a pass at him with a book she was carrying.</p>

<p>“You haven’t said a thing about the races you
are going to have with Longley Academy,” came
from Mary Rover. “Who is going to be in
them? And when are they to take place? And
are we going to be able to see them?”</p>

<p>“That’s all right, Cousin Mary! Fire three
questions at a fellow all at once!” broke out
Randy. “There are to be some single shell races,
a four-oared race, and an eight-oared race. Also<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>
they are talking of getting up a race between two
of the motor-boats.”</p>

<p>“My! but a race between motor-boats would
be exciting,” murmured Martha.</p>

<p>“Andy and Randy are to be in one of the four-oared
races,” said Jack. “Who is to row with
them hasn’t yet been decided. Probably Spouter
and Dan Soppinger. A lot of the other fellows
will be in the singles and in the eight-oared events.
The contests are to come off a week from next
Saturday.”</p>

<p>“Where will they be held?” questioned May.</p>

<p>“That’s to be decided in a few days. Longley
wants ’em on the other side of the lake and we
want ’em on this side. I hope they have ’em on
this side, because then all the folks living in and
around Haven Point will be able to witness them.”</p>

<p>All too soon the visit had to come to an end,
and with cheery good-bys the boys hurried back
to Haven Point. They found Bob Nixon waiting
for them.</p>

<p>“I was going to give you five minutes more,”
declared the Hall chauffeur. “We’d better be
getting back. It’s getting late.”</p>

<p>After that matters went along smoothly for
several days. The Rover boys paid close attention
to their studies. During that time the boys
heard from the aviator and his wrecked biplane.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span>
It had been found that the biplane could be raised
with comparative ease, and this had been done
and it had then been floated over to the shore.
The propeller was broken, as already mentioned,
and one of the wings of the flying machine was
also damaged. It was learned that the motor
had become loosened from its fastenings, just as
the other aviator had surmised, and this had
caused all the trouble. The machine was taken
away and the aviators went with it, and that was
the last seen or heard of them for the time being.
The aero corporation paid Mr. Stevenson’s doctor’s
bill. Perhaps they looked for a suit for
damages, but it was not forthcoming.</p>

<p>The next Sunday the Rover boys attended one
of the churches at Haven Point and met Mary
and Martha and a number of the other girls.</p>

<p>“It’s been decided that we’re to hold the races
on this side of the lake,” said Fred, after the
services were over and they were outside talking
to the girls. “It was decided by a toss-up,
and, believe me, the Longley crowd was mad
when they lost. They chewed it over for nearly
an hour before they would give in. They said
that it would be much better to race over on the
other side of the lake, along where the Hasley
Shell Loading Company used to have its ammunition
plant.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span></p>

<p>“Good gracious! do they want to blow us all
up?” questioned Martha, who had not forgotten
the terrible experience all of them had had when
some of the buildings of the shell loading company
had been blown up, as related in detail in
“The Rover Boys Under Canvas.”</p>

<p>“Oh, as far as that is concerned, the plant went
out of existence long ago,” answered Jack. “But
there isn’t much of a population over there, and
it will be much nicer to have it on this side where
so many people can look at it from the shore.
It was decided that Longley Academy should
have the use of one of the big docks, so they’ll
have no cause to complain.”</p>

<p>“Can we be on hand to see the races?” questioned
Ruth.</p>

<p>“That, of course, will depend on what Miss
Garwood has to say,” answered the young major.
“But I think Colonel Colby will see her about it
and fix it up. And if he does, you may be sure
that we’ll take care of all of you.”</p>

<p>“I know Tommy Flanders expects to row.
He’s been bragging about it everywhere,” declared
May.</p>

<p>“Well, he used to brag a good deal about baseball,”
answered Andy.</p>

<p>“He says that he has gotten all over the trouble
that he had with his arm and that this season<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
he’s going to pitch again,” went on Spouter’s
cousin.</p>

<p>A little later the Rovers found themselves returning
to Colby Hall on foot. It was rather
a misty day, and before they had covered half
of the distance to the school it had begun to
rain. The sky grew exceedingly dark.</p>

<p>“I don’t like this much!” exclaimed Fred.
“Not an umbrella nor a raincoat in the bunch,
either!”</p>

<p>“I don’t want to get this uniform wet,” put in
Randy. “It’s the best I’ve got.”</p>

<p>“Mine is getting awfully tight,” commented
Fred. “If it begins to shrink I don’t know what
I’ll do.”</p>

<p>“Colonel Colby’s uniforms don’t shrink,” put
in Jack. “Your uniform is tight because you’re
getting too fat, Fred.”</p>

<p>“Oh, let up on my getting fat,” pleaded the
youngest Rover. “I’m not half as fat as Fatty
Hendry.”</p>

<p>“And you don’t want to be!” exclaimed Randy.
“Gosh! Fatty’ll never have to work for a living.
All he’ll need to do is to sit on a platform in
a side show and look pleasant and sell his photographs
for twenty-five cents a copy.”</p>

<p>The downpour now became so heavy that the
lads were forced to seek shelter in an old barn<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
standing by the side of the road. So far there
had been no thunder or lightning, but now they
heard a distant rumble, and presently the sky to
the westward was brilliantly illuminated.</p>

<p>“Gee! I guess we’re in for a regular summer
storm,” said Fred. “Wish we were back at the
Hall.”</p>

<p>“We’ll be late for dinner, that’s certain,” said
Randy.</p>

<p>The rain continued to come down and presently
there was more lightning followed by a
sharp clap of thunder.</p>

<p>“It’s getting worse,” said Jack.</p>

<p>“I hope the lightning doesn’t strike this old
shack,” answered Fred.</p>

<p>“Oh, it isn’t likely, Fred. I think——”</p>

<p>What Jack thought will never be known, for
at that instant there came a crash of another
sort, followed by a yell and a jingle of glass.
Through the side of the old barn broke a big
six-cylindered touring car. The hood of the
car was carried away by the impact, and the machine
turned over on its side, burying its single
occupant, a man, beneath it.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII<br />
<small>WHO THE MAN WAS</small></h2>
</div>


<p>For several seconds after the crash came the
four Rover boys were so startled that they did
nothing but stare at the overturned touring car.
The sky being so overcast, it was dark in the
barn, so they could see little. Then, however,
came another flash of lightning which revealed
to them the body of the man lying partly outside
and partly under the overturned tonneau, the top
of which had been completely wrecked.</p>

<p>“Gosh, I wonder if he’s killed!” gasped Fred.</p>

<p>“Looks as if he might be,” returned Jack, for
the man neither moved nor made any outcry.</p>

<p>The wheels of the automobile were still spinning
around and two or three strokes came from
the engine. But then the power died away and
the wheels stopped.</p>

<p>“If only the wreck doesn’t catch on fire!” burst
out Randy. He well knew the danger from such
a source. As all of my young readers must
know, gasoline is very inflammable when unconfined
and needs but a single spark to touch it off.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span></p>

<p>“She’s leaking, all right! And it isn’t the
radiator, either!” announced Randy, as another
flash of lightning came in through the open doorway
and the broken side of the old barn.</p>

<p>Jack was already looking around the structure,
and now he found what he wanted—a couple of
beams which had been used to brace up the old
building.</p>

<p>“Come on, quick! We’ve got to pry the machine
up and pull that man out,” he ordered.
“Everybody on the job!”</p>

<p>His cousins understood and all four boys went
to work with a will. Fortunately, the instructions
received during the Hall encampment now
stood them in good stead; and under Jack’s directions
they soon placed two large stones in position
and then, using the beams as levers, pried up
the car, the others holding it while Fred pulled
the unfortunate individual from beneath.</p>

<p>“Bend down, Fred, and see if there’s anybody
else in the car,” cried Jack. “There might be
someone we didn’t notice.”</p>

<p>The young captain did as asked. All he could
discover was a light overcoat and a gladstone bag,
and he hauled both of these out. Then the car
was allowed to settle once more. Both the gasoline
and the water were running from it, but so
far there seemed to be little danger of fire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span></p>

<p>“Unless, of course, the lightning should strike
the place,” said Jack. “Then everything will go
up in a hurry.”</p>

<p>The fumes of the gasoline were now heavy,
and the Rover boys lost no time in carrying the
man outside. He was unconscious, but they were
glad to know that he was not dead. His face
was covered with dirt and blood and his clothing
was torn away from his left arm, which was
also bleeding.</p>

<p>“A pretty bad case, I should say,” said Fred.
“He looks a little bit familiar to me, too. Do
any of you recognize him?”</p>

<p>“Can’t recognize anybody with so much blood
and dirt,” announced Andy.</p>

<p>All set to work to do what they could for the
hurt man, fearing every instant that he might
die on their hands. Despite the rain, they
scooped up water from a nearby pool and, using
their handkerchiefs, bathed the sufferer. They
were doing this when he gave a gasp and presently
opened his eyes.</p>

<p>“Oh, oh!” he groaned. “What did I hit?
Was it a barn?” and then he closed his eyes again.</p>

<p>“Maybe he isn’t hurt as badly as we thought,”
cried Jack, in relieved tones. “There doesn’t
seem to be any glass in his eyes, and he can be
mighty thankful for that.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span></p>

<p>Fred and Andy had gone for more water, and
presently came back with an old tin can filled.
With this Jack continued to bathe the face of
the sufferer, washing the blood away as best he
could, while Randy worked over the man’s arm,
which was cut and scratched in a dozen places.</p>

<p>It was still very dark, but an occasional flash
of lightning lit up the scene, and it was during
one of these flashes that Jack suddenly uttered
an exclamation.</p>

<p>“Do you know what I think?” he exclaimed.
“I think this is Mr. Garrison!”</p>

<p>“What! Gif’s father?” ejaculated Fred.
“Uncle Fred?” He had always called the man
after whom he had been named “uncle,” even
though they were not relatives.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, it’s Gif’s father!” answered the
young major. “It’s a wonder I didn’t recognize
him before!”</p>

<p>“Gif’s father! Think of that!” murmured
Andy. “Gee, I hope he isn’t hurt very much! It
will be a terrible shock to Gif, not to say anything
about his mother!”</p>

<p>Having recognized the man as the father of
one of their best chums, and one who in years
gone by had been a great chum of the older
Rovers, the boys renewed their efforts on behalf
of the sufferer, carrying him to a shed some distance<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span>
back of the old barn. Here they found
some straw and a few empty bags and laid Mr.
Garrison upon those.</p>

<p>“We might better get a doctor for him and
telephone the news to Colby Hall,” said Jack.
“I guess I can run back to Haven Point and get
someone.”</p>

<p>“Want me to go with you?” asked Andy. “Or
would you rather that the three of us stayed here
and took care of him?”</p>

<p>“You’d better stay and do everything you
can,” answered the young major, and then set
off on a dog-trot through the rain.</p>

<p>Less than half an hour later Jack had obtained
the services of a Doctor Parsons, who happened
to be in his office at the time, and had likewise
telephoned to Colby Hall, getting Captain Dale
on the wire. The captain had said that he would
at once inform Gif and also Colonel Colby and
that someone would come to the old shed as
speedily as possible. Then the young major and
the doctor set off in the latter’s automobile for
the scene of the accident, the physician taking
bandages and his medical case.</p>

<p>In the meantime those left at the shed continued
to do what they could for Mr. Garrison,
and presently had the satisfaction of seeing him
open his eyes once more. The storm was lessening,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>
the lightning and thunder fast drawing off
to the eastward, and it was growing lighter.</p>

<p>“Oh, my head!” murmured the sufferer. “And
my arm! What’s the matter with my arm?” he
questioned feebly.</p>

<p>“You’ve had a terrible shaking up, Uncle
Fred,” said his namesake kindly.</p>

<p>“Uncle Fred? Who is that that is speaking?”
The man stared at the young captain. “Why, I
declare, it’s Fred Rover! Where did you come
from?”</p>

<p>“We were in the old barn keeping out of the
rain when you smashed into it and upset your
machine.”</p>

<p>“We? Who do you mean? Oh, I see! Here
are Andy and Randy.” Mr. Garrison tried to
go on, but for the moment was too weak to do
so. “I thought I was going to be killed!” he
groaned.</p>

<p>“I suppose your car skidded?” suggested
Randy.</p>

<p>“It did. You see, I thought it wouldn’t be
necessary to put on the chains because I was
going to stop at Haven Point, and then go up
to the school to-morrow. I came around the
curve and then, all of a sudden, lost control, and
the next thing I knew I hit something and then—and
then I didn’t know anything.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span></p>

<p>“That was when you smashed through the side
of the barn almost where we were standing.”</p>

<p>“Did I hurt you?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no. We weren’t touched. But the car
went over and you were caught under it and we
had to drag you out,” answered Andy. “The
glass cut you up pretty well and something tore
the clothing from your arm and hurt it.”</p>

<p>Mr. Garrison tried to sit up, and then fell back
helplessly.</p>

<p>“I feel as if I’d been through a wringer,” he
murmured. “Can you get a doctor?”</p>

<p>“Jack has already gone for one.”</p>

<p>“Oh, then he was here too?”</p>

<p>“Yes. He has gone to Haven Point to get a
doctor, and said he would telephone to Colby
Hall.”</p>

<p>“Poor Gif! And I was going to give him a
pleasant surprise to-morrow,” murmured the sufferer.
“Well, I suppose I can be thankful I
wasn’t killed or hurt worse. The glass might
have gotten into my eyes and blinded me.”</p>

<p>A little later the physician and the young major
arrived and the medical man went to work at
once over the sufferer.</p>

<p>“It doesn’t look as if any bones were broken,”
he announced, after a careful examination. “But
he has received quite a shock and a severe bruise<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>
on the head and another on his arm besides all
these cuts and scratches.”</p>

<p>He was still at work when an automobile drew
up nearby, driven by Bob Nixon. It contained
Colonel Colby and Gif.</p>

<p>“My dad! Where is my dad?” demanded Gif
excitedly. “Is he badly hurt?”</p>

<p>“The doctor says it isn’t serious, Gif,”
answered Jack, catching his chum by the arm,
for he could see that Gif was trembling all over.
“Take it easy, old man. He only got bumped
and scratched.”</p>

<p>There was a good deal of excitement for a few
moments, Gif kneeling by his father’s side and
holding his uninjured hand tightly. Everyone
present could see how much the father and son
thought of each other. Then Colonel Colby came
forward to greet the man who in years gone by
had been his schoolmate at Putnam Hall.</p>

<p>“Tough luck, Fred!” he said kindly. “But
we’re all mighty glad that you weren’t killed.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m glad myself, Larry,” responded Mr.
Garrison, and for just an instant his old-time
smile flitted across his face.</p>

<p>At first it was decided to take Mr. Garrison to
the doctor’s home in Haven Point. But Gif demurred
somewhat at this, and Colonel Colby
caught the cadet by the arm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span></p>

<p>“Would you rather have him at the Hall?”
questioned the master of the institution kindly.
“If so, I’ll be only too glad to let him use one
of the rooms in my house. Young Professor
Ditson has left, and your father might as well
have that room as not. It overlooks the river
and would be an ideal place for him.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Colonel! If you only would take him up
there,” cried Gif, “then I could see him two or
three times a day. And I’m sure mother would
feel better, too. You know, she thinks a great
deal of you and your school.”</p>

<p>“Then we’ll take him to the Hall,” was the
prompt reply. “I think we can carry him right
up in our automobile, and we’ll ask the doctor to
come along so that he can do everything possible
for your father after we put him to bed.”</p>

<p>The heavy storm had now let up considerably,
although the dark clouds still hovered to the eastward
and the rumble of thunder could be heard
in the distance. With great care the men and
boys, assisted by the chauffeur, managed to get
the sufferer into the back of the Colby Hall automobile.
There he was made as comfortable as
possible on a bedding of straw, sacks, and robes.
Then all set out for the school, followed by the
doctor, who carried several of the cadets with him,
Colonel Colby and Gif riding with the sufferer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span></p>

<p>The news of the accident had spread, and quite
a number of cadets were on hand to see Mr.
Garrison taken from the automobile and placed
in the residence occupied by Colonel Colby’s
family and some of the professors. But there was
no noise or confusion, and the cadets were informed
that they must keep away from the place
until further orders. In the meanwhile, a trained
nurse had been telephoned for, and she soon
arrived from Haven Point and took charge under
the physician’s directions.</p>

<p>“Gee, you fellows don’t know how thankful I
am to you for what you have done,” said Gif
earnestly to the Rover boys. He had had a toothache
that morning, and consequently had not gone
to church with the others. Now the excitement
had driven the toothache completely away.</p>

<p>“We are glad we were on hand to help him,”
answered Jack.</p>

<p>“Seems to me we’re becoming regular ‘Johnnies
on the Spot,’” chuckled Andy. “First when the
flying machine went to pieces and now at this auto
accident!”</p>

<p>When the doctor finally came away he told Gif
that his father would probably be all right in a
week or ten days.</p>

<p>“The bruises are just plain bruises and nothing
else,” declared the physician. “Of course, his face<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span>
and his arm will feel mighty sore for a while and
it will take time for those cuts and scratches to
heal. But so far as I can see there is nothing
serious.”</p>

<p>Several days passed, and during that time the
smashed automobile was taken away. Mr. Garrison
was soon able to sit up and enjoy his
meals. He spent many a pleasant hour with
Colonel Colby, the two talking over their numerous
adventures while they had been classmates
with the older Rovers.</p>

<p>“I came to give Gif and his chums a little surprise,”
said Mr. Garrison.</p>

<p>“Well, you gave them a surprise, all right
enough,” broke in Colonel Colby, with a twinkle
in his eyes.</p>

<p>“It wasn’t that kind of surprise, Larry,”
answered Mr. Garrison. “I had quite something
else in my mind,” and then he mentioned what
it was.</p>

<p>“That’s fine, Fred! Fine!” exclaimed the owner
of the Hall. “I’m sure that Gif will be delighted,
and his chums too. I know that that whole bunch
of boys was tickled to death when Songbird
Powell invited them out to Big Horn Ranch.”</p>

<small>THE FOUR-OARED RACE</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Following the conversation between Colonel
Colby and Mr. Garrison Gif called upon his father
and the two held a talk lasting the best part of
an hour. When the son was ready to leave his
face glowed with satisfaction.</p>

<p>“It’s dandy of you, Dad! Just dandy!” he
said, catching his parent by the hand. “And won’t
the others be surprised!”</p>

<p>“Are you going to tell them now, Gif? Before
I arrange those details?”</p>

<p>“I suppose I might. But, no! I think I’ll keep
them guessing for a while. I’ll just hint at what
is coming.”</p>

<p>“You are to have some boat races here soon,
I believe?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Dad. They come off Saturday.”</p>

<p>“Of course you hope to win?”</p>

<p>“We certainly do! You see, I’m at the head
of the student athletic committee, and that, of
course, takes in rowing here. The races are to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span>
be against Longley Academy, the place that has
been recently turned into a military school.”</p>

<p>That day Mrs. Garrison appeared to see her
husband and was glad to know that he was not
injured nearly as much as she had anticipated. She
remained with him for several days, being the
guest of Colonel Colby, whom she knew quite
well.</p>

<p>In a large school like Colby Hall there were,
of course, many who could row well, and in the
past there had been a number of races on the
river and the lake. There were, in fact, a number
of regular crews, and the school possessed an
eight-oared shell, two four-oared shells, and a
dozen or more singles and doubles.</p>

<p>“There will be three races,” announced Gif. “A
race for the singles, one for the four-oared, and
one for the eight-oared.”</p>

<p>“What about the motor-boat?”</p>

<p>“Colonel Colby wouldn’t think of that. He
said that these contests must be contests of muscle,
not gasoline.”</p>

<p>There had been a general try-out of all the
available material for races in the school, and as
a result of this three cadets had been chosen to
represent Colby in the singles against three cadets
from the rival academy. Then four other cadets
with a coxswain were entered for the four-oared<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span>
shell and eight cadets with a coxswain for the
final event.</p>

<p>“Hurrah! we’re in the four-oared event,” cried
Randy, catching his twin by the arms. “We’re
to row in that race along with Spouter and Dan
Soppinger.”</p>

<p>“Gee, I hope we win!” was the reply.</p>

<p>“Oh, we’ve got to win!”</p>

<p>“Of course you’ve got to win,” broke in Fred.
“If you don’t win I’ll lambaste the life out of
you!”</p>

<p>“You’ve got to do it for the glory of Colby!”
exclaimed Jack. “We’ve got to smother Longley
Academy.” Secretly it fretted him and Fred not
a little to think that as officers of the school battalion
they could not participate in any of these
contests.</p>

<p>“What is Gif going to do? Just sit and look
on?” questioned Andy.</p>

<p>“No. He’s to be coxswain of the eight.”</p>

<p>“And who will manage our four?”</p>

<p>“That hasn’t been decided yet; but it will
probably be Walt Baxter.”</p>

<p>“Well, he’s all right,” answered Andy.</p>

<p>Every afternoon after the school session was
over those who were to participate in the various
races went down to the river to practice. Gif and
his assistants were here, there, and everywhere<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span>
directing the work. And even old Si Crews, the
gymnastic instructor, did what he could to aid the
cadets.</p>

<p>“If only it doesn’t rain on Saturday!” said Jack.</p>

<p>He had heard through Martha that the girls
at Clearwater Hall were to come down to Haven
Point and occupy a dock which had been hired
for the occasion. This dock and a number of
others were to be gayly decorated with bunting
supplied by Colonel Colby. To make the occasion
more festive the colonel and the owners of Longley
Academy had hired a local brass band.</p>

<p>At last the all-important day arrived, and although
it was rather cloudy early in the morning
by eleven o’clock the sun came out brightly, much
to everybody’s satisfaction.</p>

<p>The races were to start at two o’clock, and
shortly after one the visitors from all directions
began to come in; those from across the lake in
various kinds of boats and others by carriage
and automobile. Soon the docks at Haven Point
were crowded and a row of men, women and
young people lined the lake for a mile or more.</p>

<p>The Colby cadets had a dock to themselves directly
next to that occupied by the girls from
Clearwater Hall. The boys were in fine fettle,
and no sooner had they assembled than they
boomed out with their well-known refrain:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span></p>

<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Who are we?</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Can’t you see?</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Colby Hall!</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Dum! Dum! Dum, dum, dum!</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Here we come with fife and drum!</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Colby! Colby! Colby Hall!”</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>And the singing of this refrain was followed
by a blare from tin horns and the noisy sound of
many rattles.</p>

<p>But Longley was also at hand with a song of
its own, followed by wild cheering and a number
of catcalls.</p>

<p>“Here is where Colby Hall gets snowed under!”</p>

<p>“They won’t be in it with good old Longley!”</p>

<p>“Make it three straight victories, boys! Three
straight victories!”</p>

<p>And to this the cadets of Colby Hall answered
with equal vigor.</p>

<p>“Colby to the front, first, last, and all the time!”</p>

<p>“There is only one military academy on this
lake, and that’s good old Colby!”</p>

<p>“Don’t forget to show ’em what real rowing
means!”</p>

<p>And then came cries and toots and rattles from
both schools until the noise was fairly deafening
and the girls, who were between the two factions,
had to hold their ears.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, I do hope Colby Hall wins!” whispered
Ruth to Martha.</p>

<p>“You don’t wish it any more than I do,” was
the quick reply.</p>

<p>“Spouter is going to row with Andy and Randy
and Dan Soppinger,” put in May. “Oh, I do
hope they come out ahead!”</p>

<p>“I just heard something,” put in another girl,
Alice Strobell by name. “Tommy Flanders is
going to row in the four-oared race and Paul
Halliday and Billy Sands and another cadet are
to be with him.”</p>

<p>“Oh, in that case they’ll row against our
crowd!” cried Annie Larkins, her chum. And
then the brass band struck up and everybody
listened to the music.</p>

<p>The three cadets from Colby Hall to enter the
singles were Bart White, Darrell Harkness, and
Peter Floyd. They had wanted to be officers of
the battalion, but having failed of election and
still being somewhat popular Gif had given them
the chance of representing the school on the
water.</p>

<p>After all of the preliminaries had been arranged
and the judges were in their places, the first race
was called. It was for a little over a mile, around
one of the small islands and back to the starting<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span>
point. Soon the six single shells were lined up
and at a report of a pistol they were off.</p>

<p>“Go it, boys! Go it for all you’re worth!”
cried Jack enthusiastically. But this call was
swallowed up in a volume of sound from several
hundred throats.</p>

<p>The Colby Hall contestants held out well until
the island, which was the turning point, was almost
reached. Then, however, they began to lose
ground, and when the island had been passed it
was seen that the three oarsmen from Longley
were in the lead.</p>

<p>“Hurrah! Hurrah! What did we tell you!”
came from the cadets of the rival academy.
“That’s the way to do it!”</p>

<p>“Come on, boys! The race is already yours!”</p>

<p>“Pull, Colby, pull!” screamed Fred, even though
it was doubtful that his voice could carry such
a distance. “Pull as you never pulled before!”</p>

<p>Swiftly the six single shells approached the
finishing point of the race. Now it could be seen
that one of the Longley oarsmen was slowly but
surely dropping behind, while one of the rowers
from Colby was just as surely forging ahead.</p>

<p>“Bart White is crawling up!”</p>

<p>“Pull, Bart! Pull!” was the cry from a Colby
supporter. “You can win yet if you try!”</p>

<p>The finishing line was still ten yards off when<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span>
suddenly Bart White passed the fellow from
Longley who was dropping behind. Then he
fought nobly to catch the two still ahead.</p>

<p>But the distance was too short to do this, and
while he was crawling up steadily, before he
could come within a length of the two forward
shells they crossed the line amid yells from Longley
which were deafening. The first race stood
Longley first, second and fourth, with Colby
third, fifth and sixth. As there had been but
two prizes for this race, both went to Longley.</p>

<p>“Oh, dear! I hope we have better luck in
the next event,” murmured May. She thought a
great deal of her cousin Spouter, and wanted him
to win.</p>

<p>Inside of half an hour the four-oared shell race
was called, and out from one of the docks shot the
Colby boat with Andy, Randy, Dan, and Spouter
in their places and Walt Baxter as coxswain. From
another dock shot the Longley shell containing
Flanders, Halliday, Sands, and two cadets who
were unknown to our friends.</p>

<p>It was plainly to be seen that in this race
Longley Academy was “out for blood,” as the
saying goes. Tommy Flanders’ face looked so
stern that it was almost hateful, while Sands and
Halliday showed that they were going to do everything
possible to down their former schoolmates.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span></p>

<p>The intense rivalry resulted in some rather
sharp maneuvering around the starting point, and
some thought the Longley cadets endeavored to
foul the Colby boat and possibly damage it. This
led to some sharp remarks, which, however, were
quickly stopped by those in charge of the affair.
Both crews were ordered to their places and given
very definite instructions regarding the race.
Then came the word to get ready. Bang! went
the pistol. They were off!</p>

<p>This race was to be an affair of about two miles
around another one of the numerous islands which
dotted the lake. The course had been laid out
with care and motor-boats were doing their best to
keep it clear.</p>

<p>The start was a beautiful one, and for a full
half mile the two four-oared shells kept almost
side by side. Then Colby Hall crept a little bit
ahead.</p>

<p>“Hurrah! Hurrah! Colby is gaining!”</p>

<p>“That’s the way to do it, boys!”</p>

<p>“The race is ours!”</p>

<p>But this last remark a moment later was seen
to be premature, for with a mighty effort Longley
increased its stroke and slowly but surely came
up to the Colby shell and then with equal sureness
passed it.</p>

<p>“Longley is ahead!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span></p>

<p>“Stick to the front, boys! Don’t let ’em catch
you!”</p>

<p>These and numerous other cries came from the
supporters of the academy from across the lake.
Thus encouraged, Longley kept forging ahead
until a distance of at least a hundred feet separated
them from Colby.</p>

<p>“Oh, dear!” moaned May. “We’re going to
lose this race too!”</p>

<p>“Perhaps not,” answered Ruth Stevenson hopefully.</p>

<p>“Gee! why don’t our boys get a move on?”
whispered Fred to Jack. The two young officers
were side by side and the face of each showed
his intense anxiety.</p>

<p>“Maybe Walt is holding them in a little,”
answered the young major. “Those Longley boys
may be using up their muscle too quickly.”</p>

<p>Presently the island was rounded and the two
four-oared shells started for the finishing line.
Longley was still a hundred feet or more in advance
and kept that distance in spite of what the
other boat seemed to be doing to overtake them.</p>

<p>“It’s our race! It’s our race!” yelled the Longley
cadets enthusiastically, and caps, rattles, and
horns were thrown wildly up into the air.</p>

<p>Then came the last quarter of the race, and now
it could be seen that the coxswain of the Colby<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span>
shell was talking earnestly to those under him.
At once the stroke of the Colby oarsmen was increased,
and slowly but surely the craft began
to creep closer and closer to that ahead.</p>

<p>“That’s the stuff, Colby! Go to it!” yelled
Jack at the top of his lungs. “Colby! Colby!
Colby!” and this cry was taken up over and over
and over again, ringing out up and down and
across the lake.</p>

<p>And now the finish of the race was but a
hundred yards off. Longley was still nearly a
hundred feet ahead, but the oarsmen in that craft,
and especially Tommy Flanders, looked all but
winded. They tried in vain to increase their
stroke. It could not be done, and the only result
of the effort was to throw Paul Halliday out of
stroke and thus for an instant to disorganize the
whole crew. Then slowly but surely, with set
teeth and eyes that seemed to strain from their
sockets, the Colby crew came on.</p>

<p>“Row! Row!” called out Walt Baxter sharply.
“Row! Row!” suiting the words to the movement
of his body.</p>

<p>And the cadets under him did row as they had
never rowed before, and when the finishing line
was still ten yards away they flashed past the other
crew and came in victorious by half a length.</p>

<small>TOMMY FLANDERS TRIES A TRICK</small></h2>
</div>


<p>“Hurrah! We win the four-oared race!”</p>

<p>“My! but isn’t that a close finish?”</p>

<p>“Here is where Colby Hall puts it over Longley!”</p>

<p>The yells from the Colby cadets and their
friends were deafening. Many of the girls from
Clearwater Hall joined in, and Ruth became so
excited she grabbed Martha and Mary and kissed
them both.</p>

<p>“I’m so glad your cousins helped win that
race!” she said.</p>

<p>“I’m going down to see them come in,” said
Mary, and quickly made her way out of the crowd
of girls, followed by her cousin.</p>

<p>“I’m going down too!” came from Alice Strobell.</p>

<p>“So am I!” put in Annie Larkins, for these two
girls had often been in company with Andy and
Randy, and the four were quite chummy.</p>

<p>Of course Jack and Fred had to be on hand
to see the winning oarsmen come in, and they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span>
were first among the crowd to clap their cousins
and the others of the crew on the back and congratulate
them.</p>

<p>“Some race, I’ll say!” declared the young
major. “I’m proud of you!”</p>

<p>“I made them save their strength for the final
quarter,” answered Walt Baxter, in reply to a
question from several persons. “I knew Longley
couldn’t keep up the pace they set.”</p>

<p>“Oh, this is glorious!” burst out Alice Strobell,
as she and Annie Larkins came up and shook
hands with the twins.</p>

<p>Then May came forward to congratulate
Spouter, and Dan Soppinger and Walt Baxter
were not forgotten. There was a general hubbub
and a general handshaking which lasted for fully
ten minutes.</p>

<p>In the meantime the Longley crew had returned
to their dock. Here they found a number of
cadets and others to sympathize with them.
Tommy Flanders looked “mad enough to chew
nails,” as one of the Colby cadets reported later on.</p>

<p>“It wasn’t a fair race,” growled Flanders.
“They tried to foul us going around the island.”</p>

<p>“Of course they tried to foul us,” put in Billy
Sands.</p>

<p>This report, however, was not true. In fact, it
was proved by a number of eye witnesses that if<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span>
there had been any fault at all in rounding the
island it lay with the Longley crew and not with
the cadets from Colby Hall. Otherwise the race
had been a perfectly fair one from start to finish.</p>

<p>“I guess Tommy Flanders will sing in a little
lower tone of voice after this,” was Fred’s comment,
when the excitement had subsided a little.
“My, but I bet he feels sick!”</p>

<p>“He made a mistake by blowing so hard beforehand,”
answered Jack. “Now our crew can
blow and have something to blow about.”</p>

<p>There was no doubt but that the Longley following
was very much disappointed at the showing
so far made. Of course, two of their cadets
had won the singles, but the four-oared race was
considered much more important. Even the blaring
out of the brass band did not dispel their
gloom. However, a little later it was time to
get ready for the eight-oared race, and then the
spirits of the Longley boys seemed to recover.</p>

<p>“Here is where we’ll show Colby Hall what’s
what!” said one of the crowd. “After all, it’s
the eight-oared race that counts. The others are
only of secondary importance.”</p>

<p>“Sour grapes!” yelled one of the Colby cadets
who overheard this remark. “You know the
four-oared race is almost as important as the one
to come off.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span></p>

<p>As soon as they could do so, the Rover twins
and their chums who had won the four-oared race
put their shell away, had a rub-down, donned their
uniforms, and then joined the other cadets. The
Longley crew also put their shell away, and then
Tommy Flanders and his cronies seemed to disappear.</p>

<p>“I guess they don’t want to be questioned about
the race,” remarked Ruth to Martha, when they
chanced to see the Longley boys hurrying off.</p>

<p>“Well, it’s a bitter pill for anybody to swallow,”
answered Jack’s sister. “No one likes to be defeated.”</p>

<p>Flanders, Halliday, Sands and a number of
others had come over to the Haven Point side
of the lake in a private motor-boat belonging to
an old boatman named Nat Durgin. The craft
was one that had been on the lake for a great
number of years, being used for all sorts of odd
jobs.</p>

<p>“Come on! We’ll watch the last race from out
on the lake,” said Flanders. “I’m not going back
in that bunch to be laughed at.”</p>

<p>“Just my idea,” answered Paul Halliday, lighting
a cigarette.</p>

<p>They had hired the motor-boat for the afternoon,
so they could go where they pleased. Durgin
himself ran the craft, not caring to trust it in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span>
the hands of any one else. He was a nice old
fellow, although a bit lazy, and nearly everybody
around the lake knew him.</p>

<p>At the appointed time the two eight-oared shells
flashed into appearance, each manned by a sturdy-looking
crew and a coxswain. For this race there
had been chosen some of the best oarsmen at both
Colby and Longley.</p>

<p>“Here they come!”</p>

<p>“Now for another fine race!”</p>

<p>“Oh, I hope we win this one too!” cried Fred
to his cousins.</p>

<p>“So do I,” answered Randy quickly. “That
will show Longley they are not so much, even if
they did take the singles.”</p>

<p>There was a wild cheering on all sides and the
band blared forth merrily. In the meantime
the official motor-boats darted here, there and
everywhere trying to keep the other boats off
the course. This was not so easy, especially for
the sailing craft, because the wind was freshening
slightly, and those on the sailing boats wanted, of
course, to keep as close as possible in order to see
everything that took place. At last, however,
everything was in readiness, and at the report of a
pistol the two crews started off as one, side by
side.</p>

<p>“A perfect start!” cried Colonel Colby.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span></p>

<p>“I never saw a better,” put in old Si Crews.</p>

<p>The eight-oared race was to be about three
miles in length, taking a course that was triangular
in shape and bringing the boats at one
point close to the Clearwater Hall shore.</p>

<p>During the first leg of the triangle the shells
kept side by side, neither boat gaining more than
a foot over the other.</p>

<p>“Gee, but they’re both keeping at it!” cried
Jack, who was watching through a pair of fieldglasses
he had brought along.</p>

<p>“They’re both out for blood, and no mistake,”
was Spouter’s comment.</p>

<p>“Maybe Gif is holding our boys back,” suggested
Fatty Hendry. “He knows how to manage
them if anybody does.”</p>

<p>“I heard Si Crews telling him to watch their
wind,” came from Dan Soppinger. “That’s what
helped us. Walt didn’t crowd us until he knew
that we could hold out; and then he drove us
for fair. If that race had been a hundred feet
longer I’d have keeled over,” he added, with a
shake of his head.</p>

<p>On and on swept the two shells, and then it
was seen that Colby Hall was slowly going ahead,
first a foot, then a yard, then two yards.</p>

<p>“Hurrah! Hurrah!” yelled Fred, throwing his
cap into the air. “Now our boys are doing it!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span></p>

<p>“Colby! Colby!” was the cry that swept across
the water. “Go it, boys! Go it!”</p>

<p>“Pull, Longley, pull!” was the cry of the opposition.
“You can do it! Pull for all you’re
worth!”</p>

<p>And then there was such a hubbub that hardly
a word of what was said could be understood.
As before, the horns and rattles added to the din,
and if the brass band was playing nobody heard it.</p>

<p>Gif was certainly handling his crew superbly,
but the coxswain of the Longley oarsmen also
understood his business, and now he increased
the stroke just a little and then slowly but surely
Longley began to creep up an inch at a time.
Now it was less than a yard behind, now only a
foot, and now the two shells were once more
bow and bow.</p>

<p>“That’s the way to do it, Longley! Hurrah!”</p>

<p>“Keep it up! Make Colby take your wash!”</p>

<p>There had been a moment of intense suspense
and silence, but now another roar went forth
as the hopes of Longley revived. Everybody was
again on his feet and all sorts of objects were
thrown into the air, many of them going overboard
into the lake. And now the racers had
rounded the second mark and had but little more
than a mile to go. This was close to the shore
at Clearwater Hall, and many people lining the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span>
bank were on hand to encourage the young oarsmen.</p>

<p>Longley had crept ahead a full yard, but now
Gif spoke quietly but earnestly to those under
him. His body swayed back and forward a little
quicker and with a longer motion, and the oarsmen
caught the swing, their bodies moving with
the precision of a machine. The long eight-oared
shell seemed fairly to leap from the water, and
in a twinkling the lead of the rival shell was cut
down and Colby shot ahead.</p>

<p><a href="#i_fp098">“Hurrah! Look at that!”</a> was the cry. <a href="#i_fp098">“Colby
leads!”</a></p>

<div class="figcenter" id="i_fp098">
  <img src="images/i_fp098.jpg" alt="" title="" />
  <div class="caption">
    <p class="noic"><a href="#Page_98">“HURRAH! LOOK AT THAT! COLBY LEADS!”</a></p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>“Come on, you duffers!” yelled Dan Soppinger.
“Come on! The race is yours!”</p>

<p>“We’re waiting for you with open arms!”
screamed Fatty Hendry.</p>

<p>As the two shells swept on with less than three
quarters of a mile still to be covered, the sailboats
and motor-boats began to crowd in behind
to get a better view of the finish. This caused
something of a mix-up, in which two sloops
came to grief, one losing her bowsprit. But to
this accident nobody just then paid any attention.</p>

<p>Among the motor-boats to come up on the outer
side of the course was that containing Tommy
Flanders and his cronies. The fellow who the
season before had been batted out of the box and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span>
who had just now lost in the four-oared race,
was so savage and gloomy he was almost ready
to do anything. Privately he had bet not only on
the race which he had helped to lose, but he had
also bet rather heavily on the race now taking
place. Already he could see all his spending
money being swept away and himself in debt to
several of his fellow cadets.</p>

<p>“Hi! let me run the boat a little, Durgin,” he
said suddenly to the old boatman. “I want to
get a good view of this finish.”</p>

<p>“I’ll run her. Just tell me where you want
to go,” answered Nat Durgin. Even though the
motor-boat was rather old, she had been newly
painted and he was rather choice of her. He
knew that other boats would crowd in and he
did not wish to get into any mix-up and have his
craft scratched up.</p>

<p>But Flanders would not listen, and crowding
the old boatman to one side he seized the wheel
of the motor-boat and sent the craft ahead almost
directly for the spot for which the two
racing shells were heading.</p>

<p>“Hi! Hi! Don’t go too close!” cried old
Durgin, in alarm. “Don’t interfere with the
race!”</p>

<p>“I know what I’m doing!” answered Tommy
Flanders. “You let me alone!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span></p>

<p>It was now plain to Tommy’s cronies that he
was up to some trick. The shell closest to the
motor-boat was that belonging to Colby Hall, and
now it was less than twenty yards away.</p>

<p>“That’s right, Tommy!” chuckled Paul Halliday.
“Give ’em a whole lot of wash! Soak ’em
good!”</p>

<p>“That’s what I’m going to do,” hissed Flanders
through his set teeth. And then he drove the
motor-boat still closer.</p>

<p>“Get away from there! Get away from there!”
was the cry from one of the motor-boats that
was trying to keep the course clear.</p>

<p>“Go to grass!” muttered Billy Sands. “Drive
her in, Tommy! Give ’em all the wash you can!”</p>

<p>“You’ll hit their oars, you young fool! Keep
away from there,” suddenly yelled old Nat Durgin,
and then he tried to push Tommy Flanders
away from the wheel.</p>

<p>“Let me alone!” said Flanders, and began to
struggle.</p>

<p>Nat Durgin’s blood was up. He did not like
Flanders or his cronies any too well, and they
had beat him down in the price to be paid for
the use of the motor-boat. Without ceremony the
old man slapped Flanders heavily in the face,
then shut off the motor and turned the craft out
into the lake.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span></p>

<p>“That’s the stuff, Durgin!” shouted a man from
one of the boats lying nearby. “Throw that
young fool overboard!”</p>

<p>“That’s right! Give him a bath!” came from
another boat.</p>

<p>“Say! what do you mean by hitting me?”
roared Tommy Flanders, in a rage. “You keep
your hands off of me!”</p>

<p>“And you keep your hands off the wheel of
this boat!” returned old Durgin sternly.</p>

<p>“I won’t pay a cent for the use of this boat!”
snapped Tommy.</p>

<p>“You say another word and I’ll have you locked
up for disorderly conduct,” answered the old boatman
heatedly. “You sit down and behave yourself.
I’m running this boat, and you’re not going
to break up that race.”</p>

<p>“I wasn’t going to break up the race,” muttered
Flanders in a sudden panic, for he realized that
he might get into serious trouble if a report was
made of what he had really attempted to do.</p>

<p>“We’ll see about this after the race is over,”
answered Durgin.</p>

<small>AFTER THE RACES</small></h2>
</div>


<p>“Say, boys, this is going to be another close
race,” declared Jack.</p>

<p>“My, see the boats swarming behind the shells!”
was Andy’s comment.</p>

<p>“Look at that motor-boat, will you?” came
quickly from Spouter. “Gee Christopher! what
are they trying to do?”</p>

<p>At once cries arose on all sides when it was
seen that one motor-boat was coming dangerously
close to the racecourse.</p>

<p>“It’s old Nat Durgin’s boat!” exclaimed Jack,
after looking through the fieldglasses. “And what
do you know about this? Tommy Flanders is
at the wheel!”</p>

<p>A moment later there were exclamations from
a dozen or more individuals as Durgin was seen
to cast Flanders aside and take command of the
craft. Then it was seen to veer away and was
lost to sight behind the sails of a small sloop.</p>

<p>“Here they come! And almost bow and bow!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span></p>

<p>“Colby is ahead!”</p>

<p>“No! Longley is ahead!”</p>

<p>“It’s a tie!”</p>

<p>The excitement was now tremendous as it was
seen that Longley had crept up and was now bow
and bow with the other shell.</p>

<p>“Pull, Colby! Pull!” roared the cadets from
that institution. “Pull!”</p>

<p>And the cadets from Colby urged by Gif pulled
as they had never pulled before, their eyes staring
from their sockets and their breath coming laboredly.
But Longley was also pulling, although now
the terrific pace was beginning to tell upon the
oarsmen from the rival academy. They were all
but in, and their coxswain urged them to greater
efforts in vain. Now the finishing line was in
sight, and it was then that Gif broke out in a
wild appeal to those he was directing.</p>

<p>“Now then, boys! Every ounce that’s left in
you! Go to it! Make her jump out of the water!
Make her jump good!” And with every word his
body swayed back and forth and the oarsmen responded
with every bit of vital force left in their
spent bodies. The shell leaped ahead, while at the
same moment those in the other shell slowed up,
being unable to keep up the terrific pace.</p>

<p>“It’s Colby’s race! It’s Colby’s race!” was
the yell, and it was the truth. Colby shot on and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span>
on and then crossed the finishing line a length and
three feet to the good.</p>

<p>Then it was that the cadets of Colby Hall and
their many friends rent the shore of Clearwater
Lake with their cries of exaltation—cries that
went echoing back and forth through the hills in
the distance. Jack and the others went nearly
mad with joy, throwing up their caps and hugging
each other. Randy began to do a jig while Andy
climbed a flagstaff on the dock and went twisting
around it at arm’s length. It was a moment never
to be forgotten and one that would live long in
the annals of the school on the Rick Rack River.</p>

<p>“Three cheers for Gif Garrison!” called the
young major of the battalion, and they were given
with a will, many of the girls from Clearwater
Hall joining in.</p>

<p>Then all the others who had taken part in the
various races were cheered. Many ran down to
where the eight-oared shell was now coming in,
and as soon as the crew had landed Gif was
grabbed by his many friends and hoisted up on a
pair of sturdy shoulders and marched around the
dock.</p>

<p>“Speech! Speech!” cried someone. But at this
Gif shook his head.</p>

<p>“Not just now, boys. I’m too nearly in. Some<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span>
other time. I’m mighty glad we won the race.
Thank you.” And that was all he would say.</p>

<p>Coming on top of the winning of the four-oared
race, it was certainly a great triumph, and
for the time being the loss in the singles was
forgotten. The local band was forced to lead a
march around the town in which practically every
cadet from Colby Hall and many of the girls
from Clearwater Hall, as well as some of the town
people, participated. Some had flags, while others
carried their horns and rattles, and they made the
welkin ring with their cheers.</p>

<p>“Bonfires to-night!” chuckled Andy. “Oh, boy!
but we’ll have some time, won’t we?”</p>

<p>“Right-o!” responded his twin.</p>

<p>Encouraged by the fact that the boat races
would attract a large number of visitors to Haven
Point, the owner of an amusement park on the
outskirts had made arrangements for a special
picnic with a number of attractions. The admission
to this park was free, and the cadets from
both academies, as well as the girls from Clearwater
Hall, were invited to visit the place.</p>

<p>“Let’s go down and see what’s doing,” suggested
Spouter, after the excitement attending the
races was over. “Mr. Falstein owns the park, you
know, and he has always been so nice to us we<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span>
ought to encourage him.” The man he mentioned
was the owner of the moving picture theater in
the town and most of the boys knew him well.</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t mind,” answered Randy.</p>

<p>“Don’t you feel tired after the race?” questioned
Jack.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m rested now.”</p>

<p>“We’ve got two hours before we’re due at the
Hall,” put in Andy. “Come on.”</p>

<p>The upshot of this was that the boys invited the
girls to accompany them, and after receiving permission
from one of the teachers to do so the
crowd set off for the park, which was located in
a large grove of trees less than quarter of a mile
away.</p>

<p>They found a happy crowd already collected,
indulging in swinging, the use of a merry-go-round,
and half a dozen other amusements. A
small band was playing, and half a dozen couples
were indulging in dancing on a small platform.</p>

<p>“Let’s go on the merry-go-round!” cried Andy.
“Come on!” and he caught Alice Strobell by the
arm.</p>

<p>“I’ll go if Annie will go,” answered Alice.</p>

<p>“All right, come on, Annie,” said Randy, and
the two couples lost no time in getting on the
wooden horses, which speedily whirled them
around and around.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span></p>

<p>A number of the others followed, including the
Rover girls and Gif and Spouter. Ruth said she
did not care for such a ride, and she and Jack
wandered off for a walk with May and Fred
behind them.</p>

<p>In a short while the amusement park began to
fill up and there were shrieks of laughter from
the young folks and merry music from the band.
Not a few of the visitors were from Longley
Academy, bent on having a good time in spite
of their defeats on the lake.</p>

<p>“I should think they’d want to go home,” said
Dan Soppinger, who was present.</p>

<p>“Oh, well, you can’t blame them for wanting
some consolation,” answered Walt Baxter. And
then Walt added quickly: “I think we ought to
treat ’em as nicely as possible, Dan.”</p>

<p>“Oh, sure! we’ll treat ’em all right enough,”
was the ready reply. “I like some of those fellows
first rate, even if they do go to Longley. It’s
only such cads as Flanders that I can’t bear.”</p>

<p>While Jack and Fred were strolling along with
the two girls from Clearwater Hall they were
much surprised to see Tommy Flanders, Paul
Halliday and Billy Sands coming along a bypath
with Codfish Stowell between them. The latter
did not for the instant notice our friends, who
were screened somewhat by bushes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span></p>

<p>“I want that money, Tommy. I’ve got to have
it,” they heard Codfish say in a pleading tone.
“Can’t you let me have it to-day?”</p>

<p>“I can’t let you have a cent,” grumbled Flanders.
“Didn’t I tell you I lost every dollar of my
allowance on the races?”</p>

<p>“Yes, but you promised me that five dollars
last week,” went on the sneak of Colby Hall.
“You said you would be sure to give it to me.”</p>

<p>“Oh, why don’t you shut up whining?” burst
out Billy Sands. “You had more fun out of
that affair than we did. I don’t believe you ought
to make Tommy pay for anything like that.”</p>

<p>“I don’t care! I did it because you wanted me
to and because you promised me the five dollars,”
went on Codfish stubbornly. “I think it’s awful
mean that you don’t give it to me.”</p>

<p>“Oh, give us a rest!” growled Flanders, and
then the four cadets passed on.</p>

<p>“Well, what do you think of that?” ejaculated
Fred, when the quartet were out of hearing. “I
didn’t know Codfish was hobnobbing with Tommy
Flanders.”</p>

<p>“Neither did I,” returned Jack. “I suppose he
got acquainted through Sands and Halliday. He
might rather leave that bunch alone.”</p>

<p>“I saw that Stowell boy with Tommy Flanders
in town some weeks ago,” remarked May. “They<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span>
were in the drug store having some soda. I remember
it very well from a remark that Flanders
dropped. I thought it was awfully funny.”</p>

<p>“What remark was that, May?” questioned
Jack curiously.</p>

<p>“They were talking about something Stowell
was going to do, and Flanders said, ‘Use a pillowcase
or a flour bag and it will be all right.’ And
a minute later I heard him say, ‘They’ll look like
Negroes,’ and he laughed.”</p>

<p>“What’s that?” came from Jack and Fred
simultaneously, and they exchanged glances.</p>

<p>“Why, what’s the matter?” cried Spouter’s
cousin in astonishment.</p>

<p>“Tell us about that again, May,” went on the
young major, and the girl repeated her story.</p>

<p>“That solves the whole mystery!” declared
Jack.</p>

<p>“It’s as plain as daylight,” responded the young
captain.</p>

<p>“Will you kindly tell us what you’re talking
about?” remarked Ruth, in wonder.</p>

<p>“I sure will, Ruth. We weren’t going to say
anything at first because the joke was on us, but
now I think the joke is going to be on somebody
else,” replied Jack. And thereupon he gave the
particulars of how he and his cousins had been
doused with a bag of soot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span></p>

<p>“Of all things!” burst out May. “And do you
suppose it was that trick Tommy Flanders was
talking about to Stowell?”</p>

<p>“Sure as shooting, May,” answered Fred.
“Don’t you see how it all fits together? You
heard Tommy tell Stowell to use a pillowcase or a
flour bag. That was to conceal his face. Then
he said it would make us look like Negroes, and it
certainly did. Then along comes Codfish pleading
to Flanders to pay him the five dollars he had
promised him for doing something. And then
Sands suggesting that Codfish should call it
square because he got more fun out of it than
they did!”</p>

<p>“It certainly is a clear case,” broke in Jack.
“Flanders and maybe Sands and Halliday got
Codfish to play that joke on us, and they promised
him five dollars for doing it.”</p>

<p>“Let’s go after Codfish right now!” exclaimed
the young captain, his eyes blazing.</p>

<p>“Oh, dear, don’t get into a fight!” burst out
May, catching him by the arm.</p>

<p>“No use of starting a row here, Fred,” put in
Jack quickly. “We can catch Codfish to-night
and Tommy Flanders some other time. We don’t
want to disgrace Colby Hall while this celebration
is going on. Those Longley fellows would like
nothing better than to publish the fact that we<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span>
had started a rumpus on the day of the races.”</p>

<p>“What an awful boy Tommy Flanders must
be,” murmured Ruth, “to hire another to play such
a trick as that! And then just think of how he
tried to spoil that last race!”</p>

<p>The cadets could not, however, resist the temptation
to look around for Flanders, Halliday,
Sands and Codfish. They saw the four having
some ice cream, but then Flanders, Halliday and
Sands went off by themselves and Codfish disappeared.</p>

<p>After that Jack and Fred and the girls continued
their walk. Jack learned from Ruth that
her father was steadily improving in health, but
that he was as much worried as ever over the loss
of the book of formulas.</p>

<p>“And old Uncle Barney is worried too over
the loss of his money,” went on the girl. “I’m
afraid this loss may revive the old hard feeling
there was between my father and my uncle.”</p>

<p>“It would certainly be too bad if that happened,
Ruth,” answered the young major soberly.
He knew that the girl referred to a very bitter
quarrel which had existed between old Uncle
Barney and Frederic Stevenson, a quarrel the
particulars of which have already been narrated
in “The Rover Boys on Snowshoe Island.”</p>

<p>Presently one of the teachers from Clearwater<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span>
Hall began to round up the girls from that institution,
and then the boys had to bid good-by
to their friends.</p>

<p>“I suppose we might as well be getting back
to school,” said Jack, as Andy and Randy came
up. “What do you say?”</p>

<p>“Suits me,” responded Randy.</p>

<p>“We’ve got something to tell you fellows,” put
in Fred eagerly. “Something worth knowing, I’ll
tell you!” and thereupon the two young officers
gave the particulars of what they had learned
concerning the trick played upon them.</p>

<p>“Beeswax and grasshoppers!” ejaculated Andy.
“And to think Codfish was guilty and we never
suspected him!”</p>

<p>“He certainly had nerve to play a trick like
that!” returned Randy. “I didn’t think the little
sneak had backbone enough to do it.”</p>

<p>“He was out after the five dollars Flanders
promised him,” answered Jack. “You know Codfish
was always shy on pocket money. That’s the
reason he used to toady to Nappy Martell and
those other rascals.”</p>

<p>“We ought to give it to Codfish good and plenty
to-night,” said Andy.</p>

<p>“We will!” responded his brother. “Just wait
and see!”</p>

<small>CELEBRATING THE VICTORY</small></h2>
</div>


<p>A little later found the Rover boys, accompanied
by half a dozen of their friends, bound for
Colby Hall. It was rather late, and they hurried
along with all possible speed.</p>

<p>“No parade before supper, for which I am
thankful,” remarked Jack.</p>

<p>“And supper is to be half an hour late,” added
Randy.</p>

<p>“And best of all, no studying to-night,” broke
in Andy. “Oh, my! but won’t we have some
fun!”</p>

<p>“We’ve got to catch Codfish, Andy. Don’t forget
that,” put in Randy.</p>

<p>“Forget it!” answered the fun-loving Rover.
“Why, you couldn’t make me forget it for a
million dollars. That boy is going to have a
lesson he’ll remember as long as he lives. Every
time I think how he exploded that bag of soot
on us I get madder than ever.”</p>

<p>“And after all we did for him when those<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span>
bullies were misusing him!” came from Jack. “He
certainly is a pill and then some!”</p>

<p>“Just the same, I suppose we’ve got to be careful
that we don’t get into any hot water,” remarked
Fred soberly. “We can’t afford to injure
our reputations as officers, Jack.”</p>

<p>“Why can’t you two officers leave this whole
affair to Randy and me?” questioned Andy. “You
just go off and forget all about it and take in
what happens.”</p>

<p>“I’ll see about that,” answered the young
major. He realized the point his cousin was trying
to make and yet he was angry enough to
give the sneak a sound thrashing.</p>

<p>The boys had walked on a distance of a quarter
of a mile and were coming out along the lake
front when suddenly Spouter, who was walking
ahead with Dan Soppinger, uttered an exclamation.</p>

<p>“Look down there at the dock!” he cried.
“Looks like a fight going on!”</p>

<p>“That’s what it is!” exclaimed Gif.</p>

<p>“Why, it’s Tommy Flanders and his crowd
and they are beating up old Nat Durgin!” came
quickly from Fred.</p>

<p>“I’ll bet they got into a row about hiring that
motor-boat,” remarked Andy. “Let’s go down
and see what happens.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span></p>

<p>“They have no right to beat up poor old Durgin,”
returned Jack. “He’s not a half-bad sort,
even though he is rather lazy.”</p>

<p>The crowd of cadets hurried their steps and
soon came closer to the scene of the quarrel.
They had seen Tommy Flanders strike the old
man in the face, and now Nat Durgin responded
with a blow on the shoulder. Then Flanders
jumped in, followed by Billy Sands and Paul
Halliday, and the three boys from Longley
Academy bore the old boatman to the ground.</p>

<p>“Stop that!” cried Jack. “Let up on him!”
He had leaped to the front and caught Tommy
Flanders by the arm. Almost at the same instant
Gif and Spouter grabbed Sands and Halliday.</p>

<p>“Take ’em off! Take ’em off!” cried old
Durgin. He was all but winded by his exertions.
Evidently the quarrel had been going on for
some time.</p>

<p>“Huh! what do you want here, Jack Rover?”
demanded Tommy Flanders sullenly. “You keep
your hands out of this!”</p>

<p>“You let Durgin alone, Flanders,” answered
the young major.</p>

<p>“What’s the meaning of the row, anyhow?” demanded
Gif.</p>

<p>“You’re a fine bunch of cadets to pile on an
old man three at a time!” sneered Spouter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span></p>

<p>The three boys from Longley Academy looked
anything but comfortable as they saw themselves
surrounded by the crowd from Colby Hall. They
stepped back from where Nat Durgin lay, and
Randy and Dan Soppinger assisted the old boatman
to his feet. Near by was Durgin’s pipe, and
Ned Lowe picked this up and gave it to him.</p>

<p>“I’ll have the law on you for this, you see if
I don’t!” roared Durgin, now that he saw that
friends were at hand. “I’ll teach you young
whelps to knock me down!”</p>

<p>“You hit me first,” retorted Flanders. “Don’t
forget that! I’ve got my friends to prove it!”</p>

<p>“So I did hit you first,” answered Durgin
readily. “And you deserved it too—wanting to
break up that last shell race!”</p>

<p>“Did he really try to break up that race?”
questioned Gif eagerly. “I saw him at the wheel
of your motor-boat when we were on the homestretch.”</p>

<p>“That’s what he did!”</p>

<p>“It’s not so!” blustered Flanders.</p>

<p>“It is so! He wanted to steer the boat and I
told him I’d do it. Then he shoved me aside
and grabbed the wheel and steered right for your
shell. Then I slapped him in the face, turned off
the power, and steered my boat away from the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[117]</span>
course. A whole lot of people on the other boats
saw it.”</p>

<p>“That was a fine piece of business, Flanders!”
said Gif contemptuously. “A fine piece of business,
trying to spoil our chance to win! You
ought to be hooted out of Longley Academy for
it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, say, Garrison, don’t get so smart,” put
in Paul Halliday. “Tommy wasn’t going to run
into your shell, or anything like it. He simply
wanted to get close so he could see what was
going on. All the boats were crowding in.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want anything from you, Halliday.
I’ve got your number, and always have had,” returned
the cadet who was at the head of the Colby
Hall athletic committee, and who had been the
coxswain of the eight. “I know you thoroughly.”</p>

<p>“We don’t belong at Colby Hall any more, and
you’ve got no right to say anything to us,” remarked
Billy Sands.</p>

<p>“Well, we’ll take the right when you knock
down a man as you did Durgin,” came from
Spouter.</p>

<p>“They haven’t paid me for the use of my boat,
either,” complained the old boatman. “That’s
what started the row here. They said they would
pay me right after the races.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</span></p>

<p>“I’ll bet I know why they didn’t pay up,” broke
out Andy, with a grin. “Most likely they lost
all their pocket money betting the wrong
way.”</p>

<p>“Hi, you shut up, Rover! You make me sick!”
cried Tommy Flanders, glaring at Andy sullenly.</p>

<p>A wordy war followed, lasting several minutes.
Then Nat Durgin walked to where his motor-boat
was tied up and sprang aboard the craft.</p>

<p>“You fellows pay me what you owe me or I’ll
have the law on you,” he called out, and then he
added to the boys from Colby Hall: “Much
obliged to you fellows for what you done for me.”</p>

<p>“Hi! Wait!” cried Halliday. “You’ve got to
take us across the lake!”</p>

<p>“I won’t take you nowhere,” bellowed Nat Durgin.
“I’m done with you! But you’ve got to
pay me what you owe me or I’ll do what I said
before—I’ll have the law on you,” and with this
parting shot he started up his motor and moved
slowly away.</p>

<p>“Now see what you did!” cried Billy Sands in
anger, as he faced the Colby Hall cadets. “How
are we going to get back to school? All the other
boats have left.”</p>

<p>“That’s your affair, not ours,” answered Jack.
And then he continued as he stepped closer to the
trio of discontents. “My cousins and I ought to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span>
give the whole three of you a sound thrashing.”</p>

<p>“We know what you got Codfish Stowell to
do,” broke in Andy. “Some day we’ll square
that account, and don’t you forget it!”</p>

<p>“Hi! you fellows make me tired,” grumbled
Flanders, and then he moved off, followed by his
cronies. At a safe distance he turned around
and shook his fist at the Colby Hall cadets. “You
just wait! I’ll get square some day!”</p>

<p>“Gee! what a meek and innocent little lamb he
is,” was Spouter’s comment, as the boys hurried
for the Hall.</p>

<p>“Say,” put in Phil Franklin, who was in the
crowd but who had taken no part in the discussion
with their rivals, “did they get Codfish to
play that trick on you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, if you must know it,” answered Randy.</p>

<p>“But don’t let Codfish know about this,” broke
in Andy quickly. “He thinks his secret is safe.
We just learned about it during this afternoon
and we want to surprise him.”</p>

<p>“All right, then, mum’s the word,” returned
Phil, and the others said the same.</p>

<p>On account of the incident at the lakeshore the
boys were somewhat late in reaching the Hall.
Snopper Duke, one of the professors, frowned a
little at this, but otherwise no comment was made.
It was felt that this was a festival night and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[120]</span>
that the cadets ought to be allowed to do very
much as they pleased.</p>

<p>In anticipation of a possible victory a number
of the boys had collected a mass of boxes and
barrels and other wood for fires, and shortly after
the evening meal these beacons began to blaze
along the shore of the Rick Rack. In the meantime
the cadets donned their old uniforms and
then one after another came forth to shout and
sing and cut up generally.</p>

<p>“After such a victory they deserve a good
time,” was Colonel Colby’s comment. The master
of the school had not forgotten his own good
times while he had been a cadet at Putnam Hall.
“Let the boys cut loose, Captain Dale, so long as
they don’t do any real harm.”</p>

<p>Of course, “Shout” Plunger, the school janitor,
who was very deaf and who had to be shouted
at in order to hear, came in for quite some
horseplay, as did also Bob Nixon and Si Crews.
Shout was made to stand on a box and sing,
which he did in a queer cracked voice that brought
forth roars of laughter. Bob Nixon had to tell
a funny story. He had been warned that he
might be made to do this, so had prepared himself
by digesting the contents of an old joke book,
and therefore got off a number of jokes that most
of the boys had heard a dozen times.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span></p>

<p>“Now then, everybody in a grand march!”
cried Dan Soppinger gayly, and then the cadets
began what they called a serpentine hop, which
consisted of a long line of cadets winding in and
out around the bonfires and the trees on the edge
of the parade ground. A few had torches, and
others musical instruments consisting of banjos,
ukuleles, mouth harmonicas, cornets, tin horns,
clappers and various other things more or less
melodious.</p>

<p>Henry Stowell was standing somewhat apart
from those who were taking part in the serpentine
hop when suddenly he found himself seized from
behind and somebody whispered in his ear.</p>

<p>“One of the professors wants to see you up in
your room right away, Stowell,” said the person
behind him. “Don’t delay! It’s very important.”
Then before the sneak could turn around to see
who had delivered the message the unknown person
had slipped behind a nearby tree and disappeared
in the darkness.</p>

<p>“What can they want of me now?” murmured
Codfish to himself. “I haven’t been doing anything.”
Then he heaved a sigh. “Maybe I’ll be
called down for being seen in company with
Flanders and those two cadets who left Colby to
go to Longley. It was a mistake for me to be
seen with those chaps; but I wanted my money.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[122]</span>
If it’s that I’ll tell the professor Flanders owes
me five dollars. He can’t find fault with me for
wanting it back.”</p>

<p>Leaving the river front, Stowell hurried into
the school, which was now practically deserted,
the other cadets being out at the celebration and
many of the professors and the others watching
proceedings. He sped up the broad stairway and
through the corridor and then opened the door
to his own room. He had expected that the
room would be lit up, and he was surprised to
find it in darkness.</p>

<p>“Hello! Anybody here?” he questioned
abruptly.</p>

<p>Codfish had scarcely spoken when the door
slammed shut behind him, cutting out nearly all
the light coming from the corridor. Then, of a
sudden, the sneak found himself caught from
behind and something was clapped over his mouth
so that he could not utter any outcry. His assailants
said not a word, but bound his hands behind
him and then fixed a gag in his mouth so
that he could breathe but could not utter a word.
Then he heard the door locked, and a moment
later the lights in the room were turned on and
Codfish saw a sight that almost froze the blood
in his veins.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII<br />
<small>SETTLING WITH CODFISH</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Six figures surrounded Stowell, each pointing
a menacing finger at him. Each figure had a
white sheet draped around it and a white towel
pinned fantastically around the head and face
with just a small slit for the eyes.</p>

<p>While Codfish stared in alarm at the figures,
the fingers were slowly elevated until they pointed
at something suspended from the ceiling; and it
was then that the sneak of the school began to
squirm in terror. A cord ran from a ring in the
ceiling, one end of which was held in the hand
of one of the masked figures. The other end of
the cord hung down directly over the bed upon
which Stowell had been pushed. The end of the
string was wound around the tail of a green snake
all of three feet long, a snake that wiggled from
side to side as it dangled in mid-air.</p>

<p>Codfish would have screamed in terror had not
the gag prevented him. He attempted to leap
from the bed, but the masked figures were too
quick for him. Two held his hands on one side<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span>
of the bed while two more held his feet on the
other. The figure having hold of the string
gently lowered it until the head of the wiggling
reptile was less than a foot away from Stowell.</p>

<p>“Lie still!” was the stern command to the hapless
youth. “Lie still, or we’ll lower the snake
upon you! Lie still, and you shall not be
harmed.”</p>

<p>At these words Stowell for a few seconds
longer continued to struggle, but then suddenly
grew quiet, although still shaking with fright.</p>

<p>“The snake is deadly poisonous,” said another
one of the masked figures in a voice that was
hoarse and low. “Beware! Move, and one sting
from the snake will finish you! Beware!”</p>

<p>At this Stowell began to mumble something,
his face working convulsively. At once one of
the masked figures whispered in the ear of another.</p>

<p>“Maybe he can’t breathe with that gag. We
don’t want to smother him.”</p>

<p>“Ask him if he’ll keep quiet if we remove the
gag,” was the low reply.</p>

<p>Thereupon one of the figures came a bit closer
and, pointing a finger at the gag, spoke again.</p>

<p>“Henry Stowell,” it said solemnly, “listen! If
we remove the gag from your mouth do you<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span>
promise faithfully that you will not cry out?
If so, nod your head.”</p>

<p>There was a second of silence and then Codfish
nodded his head vigorously.</p>

<p>“If you cry out do you give us full permission
to give you a licking for so doing?” asked another
one of the masked figures in a deep bass voice
which, however, sounded remarkably like the
tones generally used by Andy Rover.</p>

<p>Again there was a second of silence, and then
Stowell nodded once more, but this time not so
vigorously as before.</p>

<p>“It is well!” came from another of the masked
figures. “Remember your promise, Stowell! Remember!”
Thereupon the gag was removed from
the sneak’s mouth, but his hands were still kept
tied behind him.</p>

<p>“Take that snake away! Please take that snake
away!” were Codfish’s first words as soon as he
could catch his breath. “Don’t let it bite me!”</p>

<p>“Remain on the bed, Codfish,” was the stern
reply. “Remain on the bed if you want to keep
away from the snake.”</p>

<p>“It is the wonderful noobokoliki snake,” came
in weird tones from one of the masked figures.
“The educated snake belonging to the secret order
of the Kalipops. He’ll not harm our members,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[126]</span>
but he will strike at an outsider and strike to kill.
Beware!”</p>

<p>Perhaps Stowell did not believe what was said,
but he saw that he was in the hands of the masked
cadets and he saw the wriggling snake tied to the
end of the suspended string, and he did not feel
that he could take any chances.</p>

<p>“Please let me go! Please!” he muttered in
a half sob. “I haven’t done anything! Please
take that snake away!”</p>

<p>Thereupon the six figures ranged themselves in
a circle around the cadet on the bed, and each once
more pointed a menacing finger at him.</p>

<p>“Henry Stowell, you are a sneak!” came from
one of the figures.</p>

<p>“Henry Stowell, you are a sneak!” came from
another of the figures. And thus the accusation
went around the entire circle.</p>

<p>“I—I—don’t—know what you mean,” stammered
Codfish. And now he grew pale and red
by turns, his eyes shifting from the masked figures
to the wriggling snake and then back again to the
accusing cadets.</p>

<p>“You do know!” came simultaneously from all
the others in the room. “You are a sneak!”</p>

<p>“You are a disgrace to Colby Hall!”</p>

<p>“We ought to give you the licking of your life!”</p>

<p>“Stop! Stop! Please stop!” pleaded Codfish.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"></a>[127]</span>
He was growing more and more alarmed. “Let
me tell you something. I wasn’t going to say anything
about it until the end of the term, but I
might as well tell you. I’m going to leave this
school. Next term I’m going to Longley
Academy.”</p>

<p>“Thank fortune for that!” came in a murmur
from one of the masked figures. It was Andy
who spoke.</p>

<p>“The best news I’ve heard in a year of Sundays,”
murmured his twin in return.</p>

<p>The news that Codfish was going to leave Colby
Hall came as something of a surprise to all of
the masked figures, and at a signal from one of
them they moved to a corner of the room for a
whispered conversation.</p>

<p>“The poor little beggar is scared stiff,” came
in low tones from Dan Soppinger. “We might as
well let him go.”</p>

<p>“I’d like to pay him back for the time he
reported me to Captain Dale,” put in Ned Lowe.</p>

<p>“Yes, and he ought to be made to suffer for
reporting me to Professor Duke,” put in Fatty
Hendry.</p>

<p>“Yes, and for the things he did for Gabe
Werner against us,” added Walt Baxter. “If
ever a sneak deserved a sound licking, it’s Codfish.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[128]</span></p>

<p>“Well, we might let up on some of the things
we were going to do,” whispered Randy.</p>

<p>“Just the same, I think he ought to be labeled
for what he is,” came quickly from Andy.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, we can label him all right enough,”
said several of the others quickly.</p>

<p>With one eye on the dangling snake, Codfish
had watched the masked figures with the other,
and now, seeing himself unnoticed for the instant,
the sneak slipped from the bed and started in a
wild dash for the door, the key to which was still
in the lock.</p>

<p>“No, you don’t!” cried Randy, and caught Codfish
just as he was in the act of backing up to
the door to unlock it with one of his tied hands.
“Not just yet!” And thereupon all the lads
pounced upon the sneak and threw him on the
floor.</p>

<p>“Fix him up so we can label him!” cried Andy.
“He deserves it! Hurry up before someone
comes!”</p>

<p>In a twinkling Codfish found his hands untied.
Then his coat was taken from him, followed by
his shirt. Four of the boys held him down face
front while two others approached with a can of
red paint and a small brush.</p>

<p>“A sneak you are, a sneak you have always
been and a sneak we are going to label you,” were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"></a>[129]</span>
the words uttered, and in a few seconds more the
word SNEAK was painted across Codfish’s
shoulders. Then he was turned over and the
same word, SNEAK, was painted across his
breast.</p>

<p>“Now then, into the clothes closet with him,”
was the next order. “And remember, Codfish, if
you tell a word of this to any of the professors
we’ll lick you within an inch of your life,” was
the caution given to the frightened cadet.</p>

<p>“I—I won’t say a word,” blubbered the sneak.
“Please let me alone!”</p>

<p>“We’re going to put you in the closet and keep
you there,” said one of the masked figures. Then
the figure turned to the others. “We’ll take turns
at watching him, fifteen minutes each. Here is
a club I brought along. If he attempts to open
the door of the closet and come out, knock him
in the head.”</p>

<p>“Right, Most Honorable Ruler!” came from
the other masked figures, with a profound bow.</p>

<p>“How long must I stay in the closet?” blubbered
Codfish.</p>

<p>“We’ll let you know when to come out,” was
the short reply; and thereupon he was shoved back
into his own clothes closet and the door was closed
upon him.</p>

<p>“Number Three, you are to stay here for fifteen<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"></a>[130]</span>
minutes,” was the loud command. “Then Number
Six will relieve you, and after that Number
Two.”</p>

<p>“It is well, Most Exalted Ruler!” answered
several of the other cadets. Then the door to the
corridor was unlocked and one of them peered out
cautiously.</p>

<p>“The coast is clear,” whispered Randy. “Come
on! Let’s cut for it!”</p>

<p>“What are you going to do with that paper
snake, Andy?” questioned Dan Soppinger, with a
chuckle.</p>

<p>“We’ll leave that here for Codfish to play with
after he gets over his fright,” answered the fun-loving
Rover. And then he went on in a loud
voice: “Now then, Number Three, be on guard
and have your club ready!” And thereupon one
after another all of the masked figures stole softly
from the room, closing the door behind them.
They sped to the rooms occupied by the Rovers
where they lost no time in getting rid of the sheets
and the towels.</p>

<p>“I’ll bet he won’t dare come out of that clothes
closet for a long time,” was Ned Lowe’s comment.</p>

<p>“Well, let him take his time,” chuckled Randy.
“It will give that red paint a chance to dry.”</p>

<p>“I hope the lesson will do some good,” answered<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[131]</span>
Walt Baxter. “He’s about the worst sneak I ever
heard of.”</p>

<p>“It’s too bad we didn’t have a chance to try
those other stunts on him,” came from Dan Soppinger.
“Having his head shaved would have
done him good.”</p>

<p>“Well, we’re better off as it is,” answered
Randy. “If we had shaved him maybe it might
have gotten us into trouble. As it is, I don’t
believe he’ll dare say a word about it.”</p>

<p>“We didn’t treat him half as badly as he treated
us,” answered Andy, who could not forget the
throwing of the bag of soot.</p>

<p>The boys had come up from the campus by way
of the fire-escape on the back of the building, and
now they lost no time in going below by the same
means. They mingled with their fellow cadets,
who were doing a war dance around the various
bonfires.</p>

<p>“How about it? Did you see Codfish?” questioned
Fred, as he caught sight of the twins.</p>

<p>“We did!” was the quick reply. “And we’ve
got news,” and thereupon they related as briefly
as they could what had happened in Stowell’s
room and what the sneak had said.</p>

<p>“He can’t leave Colby Hall any too quick for
me,” answered the young captain of Company C.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[132]</span>
“Halliday, Sands and that bunch are welcome to
him.”</p>

<p>The festivities along the Rick Rack continued
until after ten o’clock. Then, however, the bonfires
gradually died down and one after another
the cadets entered the Hall and went up to their
various rooms.</p>

<p>In the meantime Codfish, half scared to death,
remained in the clothes closet for the best part
of half an hour. Then, finding he could get no
reply from the person supposed to be outside on
guard, he timidly ventured to open the door and
peer out. Then he came forth into the bedroom,
to find the lights still turned on but the apartment
vacant save for the snake, which now rested on
the bed.</p>

<p>“Ugh! What am I going to do with that thing?”
the sneak murmured in new fright. Then he ran
to the doorway and, donning his coat, rushed
down the stairs. In the lower corridor he ran
into Snopper Duke.</p>

<p>“Oh, Professor! Professor! There is a
snake on my bed!” he wailed. “What shall I do
about it? I don’t want to be bit!”</p>

<p>“A snake!” repeated the professor. “How extraordinary!
How did it get there, Stowell?”</p>

<p>“I—I—some—boys— That is, I can’t really
tell you, sir,” said the sneak, with a shiver. He<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133"></a>[133]</span>
had been about to explain, but suddenly remembered
the whipping that had been promised to
him if he played the sneak again. “But the snake
is there, sir, and I don’t know what to do!”</p>

<p>“I’ll investigate,” said Snopper Duke, and
marched up the stairs and into the room, followed
by the sneak.</p>

<p>Professor Duke was by no means a timid man,
and he approached the bed boldly. A book was
handy, and this he hurled at the reptile. The
snake did not move. Then the professor came
closer.</p>

<p>“Why, it’s only a make-believe snake! It’s
made of paper!” he declared, holding it up in
his fingers.</p>

<p>“A—a—paper snake?” faltered Stowell.</p>

<p>“Yes. Someone has been playing a trick on
you, Stowell. The next time you are frightened
you had better make an investigation before you
report.” And with this rather sarcastic remark
Professor Duke strode from the room and down
the stairs.</p>

<p>“A paper snake! Oh, what a sell!” Stowell
murmured. “How they’ll laugh at me when
they hear of this!”</p>

<small>GIF’S WELCOME NEWS</small></h2>
</div>


<p>After the boat races and the affair with Codfish
matters at Colby Hall so far as they concerned
the Rover boys and their chums moved
along rapidly. The term was approaching its end,
and all the cadets were anxious to make as good
a showing in the examinations as possible.
Through some of the younger cadets the Rovers
learned what trouble Codfish had had in ridding
himself of the signs that had been painted upon
him. The small boys said that the sneak was
terribly angry over what had occurred, but was
afraid to open his mouth to any of those in
authority.</p>

<p>“He’s afraid of that licking we promised him,”
said Andy, and in that surmise the fun-loving
youth was correct.</p>

<p>Of course baseball was not forgotten at Colby
Hall this term. There were the usual games to
be played between that institution and Hixley
High, the Clearwater Country Club, Columbus<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135"></a>[135]</span>
Academy and Longley. Both Randy and Andy
were on the team this year as substitutes, and as
it happened they had little to do. The big game
this year was won by Hixley and another game
was won by the Columbus boys. Colby beat the
Country Club and Longley received a great drubbing,
the score being 14 to 3.</p>

<p>“That’s the time we put another one over on
’em!” cried Randy, in satisfaction. “I guess that
will hold ’em for a while!”</p>

<p>He and his twin had managed to get into the
game during the last three innings, and he had
made a two-bagger while his brother had made
a single which had brought in two runs.</p>

<p>As had been expected, there were no tears shed
among those who knew him well when it was
announced that Stowell was going to leave Colby
Hall and had already entered for the next term
at Longley Academy.</p>

<p>“It’s a case of good riddance to bad rubbish,”
was Fred’s comment, and to this his cousins and
his chums agreed.</p>

<p>During those days the boys saw the girls from
Clearwater Hall twice. The girls’ school was to
close a week before Colby Hall shut down, and
this would send Mary and Martha home before
their brothers and cousins.</p>

<p>“We’re going up to Valley Brook Farm first<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"></a>[136]</span>
and take Ruth with us,” said Martha. “After
that I don’t know exactly what we’re to do. What
are you going to do, Jack?”</p>

<p>“Gif says he has a secret,” answered the young
major. “He’s holding it back just as Spouter
held his secret back last term.”</p>

<p>“Then you’re to be Gif’s guests?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know what it is, Martha. After that
accident to Mr. Garrison he and Gif cooked up
something between them, but Gif won’t open his
mouth about it yet. He says it’s to be a surprise.”</p>

<p>“Well, surprises are very nice sometimes,”
put in Ruth, who was present.</p>

<p>“How is your dad, Ruth?”</p>

<p>“Oh, he’s quite well now,” was the girl’s
answer. “But he’s just as much worried as ever
about those formulas. He has been trying very
hard to get duplicates, but without success.”</p>

<p>“It ought not to be so very hard to get formulas
for making artists’ material,” remarked Mary.</p>

<p>“That’s all you know about it,” answered Jack.
“I was reading up on that subject some time ago.
It seems some of the celebrated artists made their
own pigments; and they were mighty secret about
it, too, so that no one else could make exactly the
same things. Why, some of the great pictures are
great largely on account of the paints that were
used in painting them.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[137]</span></p>

<p>“In that case I certainly hope they get the
formulas back,” said Martha.</p>

<p>The time soon came for the boys and girls to
separate. Jack was sorry to part from Ruth and
asked her if she would not write to him when she
arrived at Valley Brook Farm.</p>

<p>“I will if you’ll promise to answer,” said the
girl, and this promise was speedily given.</p>

<p>“Gee, but I’ve got a hard examination in
geometry for to-morrow!” remarked Fred when
the boys were returning to school. “I wish it
was over.”</p>

<p>“I suppose we all wish the examinations were
over, Fred,” answered the young major. “I’ve
got that examination in Latin, you know, and it’s
a hard one.”</p>

<p>They met Gif at the entrance to the campus
and noticed that their chum had a broad grin on
his face.</p>

<p>“I’ve got news for you at last,” he said. “It’s
all settled.”</p>

<p>“What’s settled, Gif?” the Rover boys questioned
in concert.</p>

<p>“Where we’re to spend a large part of this
summer’s vacation,” was the reply. “I’ve just
been waiting to hear from my dad to make sure
that everything would be all right. You’re all to
go with me, and of course Spouter is to be along,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a>[138]</span>
too. Come on down to the river and I’ll tell you
all about it. Here comes Spouter now.”</p>

<p>A few minutes later the six boys were seated
on a grassy bank overlooking the Rick Rack.
Then Gif pulled from an inner pocket a large
envelope and took from it half a dozen photographs.</p>

<p>“What do you think of this?” and he passed
one of the pictures around.</p>

<p>“Pretty nice looking bungalow, I’ll say,” was
Jack’s comment. “What’s this in front of it—a
river?”</p>

<p>“No. This is what’s in front of it,” and Gif
handed out another photograph.</p>

<p>“Why, it’s a lake!” exclaimed Spouter. “Looks
like a dandy place, too! Just look at those hills
behind it, and see those immense cedar trees!
Looks like a regular paradise, Gif. Where is it?”</p>

<p>“What do you think of this?” went on Gif, and
held out a third photograph, a picture of Mr.
Garrison standing with a fishing rod in one hand
and a big string of fish in the other.</p>

<p>“Looks like a good catch, all right,” was Andy’s
comment. “I’d like to do as well myself.”</p>

<p>“Was that taken up on that lake?” questioned
Fred.</p>

<p>“It was, Fred. And here’s another picture that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[139]</span>
was taken by my dad one day along the edge
of the lake.”</p>

<p>“A bear! A big bear!” was the cry from
several of the cadets.</p>

<p>“Is he wild?” questioned Randy quickly.</p>

<p>“Wild? Of course he’s wild! My dad snapped
the picture, but by the time he could think of
a gun the bear was half a mile away. But that’s
nothing. My dad says there used to be a whole
lot of bears around that lake. That, of course,
was before the hunters got busy and killed most
of them off.”</p>

<p>“What place is this, Gif?” demanded Andy impatiently.</p>

<p>“This is a place we are to go to this summer,
provided you fellows are agreeable. This bungalow
belongs to my father. It’s a big affair, and
used to be used by a hunting and fishing club of
which he was president. The club went to pieces
and he paid a lot of their debts and took the clubhouse
in payment. He thought of going up there
this summer, but then changed his mind and put
it up to me as to whether I thought we would
like to go. There were certain details to be arranged
first, so I didn’t say anything until everything
was settled. Now if you fellows want to
go up, say the word and we’ll go.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140"></a>[140]</span></p>

<p>“But what place is it?” queried Spouter.</p>

<p>“It’s Big Bear Lake.”</p>

<p>“Oh! I’ve heard of that place!” cried Jack.
“And I’ve heard all about the bears that used to
live along the shores of the lake. They say it’s
a dandy place for hunting and fishing.”</p>

<p>“Not much hunting in the summer time,”
answered Gif. “But the fishing is there, and we
could have a dandy time knocking around the
bungalow, and in swimming, and like that.”</p>

<p>“If you’re putting it up to me, Gif, I say let’s
go,” cried Andy quickly.</p>

<p>“Go! Of course we’ll go!” exclaimed his twin.</p>

<p>“You couldn’t hold us back,” burst out Fred.</p>

<p>“I’d just as lief go to-day and let that Latin
examination slide,” commented Jack, and at this
there was a general laugh.</p>

<p>“The best news I’ve heard in a long time,”
said Spouter. “Just think of an outing in the
shade of the primeval forest, close to the shore of
a placid lake, where we can sit and meditate and
watch the sun going down over the distant hills,
and where we can hear the hoot of the lonely owl
as it flits around seeking its mate, and where—”</p>

<p>“The ants get into the sugar, the flies into the
butter, and where you always wake up if you
happen to walk into a hornet’s nest or a den of
snakes,” finished Andy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141"></a>[141]</span></p>

<p>“Who said anything about ants or hornets, or
snakes either?” snorted Spouter. “You never do
give me a chance to say something worth
while.”</p>

<p>“Never mind, Spouter, you’ll have your chance
later on,” said Randy. “Some day when you are
all alone in camp, and we have gone on a clambake
or to hunt bears, you can stand on a rock in the
middle of the lake and orate to your heart’s content.”</p>

<p>“That’s the stuff, Spouter! Just think of standing
on a floating rock delivering an address,”
chuckled Randy. “Wouldn’t that be original?”</p>

<p>“I’ll address you if you don’t look out,”
answered Spouter, and threw a handful of dirt at
his tormentor.</p>

<p>After that the boys plied Gif with questions
in regard to the bungalow at Big Bear Lake and
as to where the place was located.</p>

<p>“All I can tell you is that we’ll take the train
to Boston and then another train to a place called
Rocky Run. That’s a small place at the upper end
of the lake. There we’ll take our boats—my
father owns three of them—and row down the
lake until we reach the bungalow. The lake, you
know, is several miles long and between a quarter
and a half a mile wide and has a number of islands
in it. One of the islands used to have a fishing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142"></a>[142]</span>
club colony on it, but the whole place burned down
several years ago.”</p>

<p>“Any other places on the lake besides Rocky
Run?”</p>

<p>“Yes. There is the town of Beldane at the
lower end. There are also a number of bungalows
at the upper end of the lake and one or two bungalows
on the opposite shore. But taking it
generally, the place is rather a wild one.”</p>

<p>“That suits me,” said Fred. “The wilder the
better.”</p>

<p>“I wonder if we’ll get a chance at one of those
bears,” mused Jack.</p>

<p>“We’d better take some guns along,” said Fred.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, we’ll have to do that!” answered Gif.
“My father said he would send us a list of just
what things we ought to take along and what
supplies we ought to get when we reach Rocky
Run. There is an old storekeeper up there named
Mumbleton, Mose Mumbleton. He has done many
favors for my father and for the members of the
fishing club generally, and my father said he
would rather have us buy our supplies there than
ship them from Beldane or Boston. It would
give Mumbleton a chance to make a little money,
and we might find his friendship worth something
to us while we were up there.”</p>

<p>After that the boys looked over the photographs<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[143]</span>
again and continued to talk about Big Bear Lake
and the good times they expected to have there
until the bell rang for the evening parade.</p>

<p>Although it was still early in June the night
proved an unusually warm one, and after having
prepared himself for the examination in Latin on
the next day Jack found it almost impossible
to get to sleep. He tumbled and tossed on the
bed for the best part of an hour and finally arose,
to sit by the open window for a while.</p>

<p>He had been resting there for perhaps five
minutes gazing out dreamily into the moonlight,
when he heard the put-put of a motor-boat on the
river. Then somewhat to his surprise he saw a
motor-boat turn in to the Colby Hall dock. Several
figures sprang ashore and hurried into the boathouse
belonging to the military academy.</p>

<p>“Hello! what does that mean? That can’t be
one of our motor-boats,” murmured the young
major to himself. “That looks mighty queer to
me.”</p>

<p>He hesitated for a moment and then aroused
his cousins.</p>

<p>“Seems to me we ought to look into this,” said
Fred. “Those fellows may be nothing but
thieves.”</p>

<p>“If some of our fellows have been out on a
lark we don’t want to get them into trouble,” said<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"></a>[144]</span>
Andy. “I move we sneak downstairs and make
an investigation.”</p>

<p>The others agreed to this, and all quickly
donned their shoes and clothing and then made for
the fire-escape, which they so often used in preference
to the regular stairway.</p>

<p>As they ran across the campus they saw three
figures steal forth from the Colby Hall boathouse.
The three figures made for the motor-boat at
the dock, and in a minute more the Rovers heard
the motor of the boat and then saw the craft
glide out into the semi-darkness of the night.</p>

<p>“Now what were they doing at the boathouse?”
questioned Jack.</p>

<p>Struck with a sudden fear, the young major
broke into a run, followed by the others. They
dashed into the boathouse, which was dark, and
in one corner saw a faint glare.</p>

<p>“It’s a fire!” gasped Fred. “Somebody has set
the place on fire!”</p>

<small>THE ROVERS AT HOME</small></h2>
</div>


<p>The young captain of the Colby Hall cadets
was right. A small fire was blazing fiercely in
one corner of the boathouse but a few feet away
from where two of the racing shells were stored.</p>

<p>“Sound the alarm, Randy!” cried Jack. “And
you, Andy, run for a pail of water. Fred and I
will get the fire extinguishers.”</p>

<p>The young cadets had had more than one fire
drill and knew exactly how to go to work to get
the best of the incipient conflagration. While
Randy ran off toward Colonel Colby’s cottage to
give the alarm, Andy grabbed up two fire buckets
which were already filled and hurried with them
toward the blaze. In the meanwhile Jack ran to
the far end of the boathouse, where was located
a fire extinguisher, while Fred sped off to the
gymnasium to get another.</p>

<p>When Andy arrived with his water he found
the blaze mounting up one side of the boathouse.
He dashed the water as high as possible, realizing
that the fire would spread rapidly if it reached<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[146]</span>
the loft overhead, which was stored with all sorts
of combustible material. Then the youth ran out
to refill the buckets at the side of the dock.</p>

<p>By the time Jack managed to arrive with the
fire extinguisher the blaze was covering one whole
end of the boathouse. He got the extinguisher
into action as speedily as possible, squirting the
fire destroying compound where he thought it
would do the most good. As Fred appeared with
another extinguisher the bell outside began to
ring and half a dozen men came running toward
the boathouse, most of them in their bathrobes
and slippers.</p>

<p>“How did this happen, Major Rover?” demanded
Captain Dale in a somewhat harsh voice.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you after the fire is out, Captain,”
answered the young major of the school battalion.
“We’ve got to work quickly here if we’re going
to put this out.”</p>

<p>“Form a bucket brigade,” ordered Captain
Dale, addressing the others who were arriving.
And while this was being done he caught the fire
extinguisher from Fred’s hands and began to
spray the contents as high up as he could reach
on the boathouse wall.</p>

<p>Inside of three minutes the whole school was
aroused and the cadets came tumbling out on the
campus in all sorts of dress and undress. As<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>[147]</span>
they came out they were stopped by Fred and
Captain Glasby of Company A, who quickly
formed them into a fire brigade and sent them
for the fire buckets and fire ladders.</p>

<p>“Gee, that’s going to be some blaze!”</p>

<p>“I hope the boathouse doesn’t burn down and
all our boats with it!”</p>

<p>“Why can’t we get the boats out?”</p>

<p>“We can! Come on, fellows, quick!” And
thereupon part of the crowd rushed into the boathouse
to save whatever could be handled.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile a hose had been attached to
a new water tower near the gymnasium, and soon
a stream from this was directed upon the flames.
For fully ten minutes it seemed to be a toss-up
as to whether the boathouse would be consumed
or not. But the professors and the cadets worked
vigorously and presently it was seen that the
flames were going down.</p>

<p>“Hurrah, boys, we’ve got the best of it!”
shouted Jack encouragingly. “Keep it up! Pass
that water along lively!” And the buckets came
along the line so rapidly that it was all three
cadets and two professors at the front could do to
empty them.</p>

<p>At last the spot where the fire had originated
was only a smoking and steaming mass. With
the conflagration out it was quite dark in and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148"></a>[148]</span>
around the boathouse and lights had to be lit
so the workers could see what they were doing.</p>

<p>“I guess it’s out,” said Colonel Colby at last,
and gave a sigh of relief.</p>

<p>“I’ll place Nixon and Crews on guard with a
number of pails of water,” said Captain Dale.
“They can remain here for the rest of the night
just as well as not.”</p>

<p>“Has any one any idea how this fire started?”
demanded the owner of the school, looking around
at the assembled professors and cadets.</p>

<p>“I have,” answered Jack. “I’m quite sure the
place was set on fire.”</p>

<p>“You surprise me, Major Rover,” answered
Colonel Colby. “What have you to tell?”</p>

<p>In a few words Jack related his story and then
the other Rovers told of what they knew concerning
the affair. As the recital proceeded Colonel
Colby’s brow grew dark.</p>

<p>“You say there were three persons in that
motor-boat?” he questioned.</p>

<p>“So far as I could see,” answered Jack. “Of
course the moonlight isn’t very strong to-night.”</p>

<p>“I saw the three fellows as they rushed back to
the motor-boat after they came from the boathouse,”
put in Randy.</p>

<p>“So did I,” added his twin, and Fred said the
same.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149"></a>[149]</span></p>

<p>“Did any of you recognize any of those persons?”</p>

<p>At this the Rover boys shook their heads.</p>

<p>“Did you recognize the motor-boat?” put in
Captain Dale.</p>

<p>At this Jack grew thoughtful and looked at
Fred.</p>

<p>“I don’t like to say as to that,” answered the
major of the school battalion slowly. “I might be
mistaken and get the wrong people into trouble.”</p>

<p>“But you think you know something?” put in
Colonel Colby quickly.</p>

<p>“I didn’t recognize the motor-boat so far as
looks go,” answered Jack. “It was the peculiar
put-put the engine made when the boat came in
and when it went away. You know, motor-boats
are apt to have a peculiar sound of their own.”</p>

<p>“What did this motor-boat sound like, Rover?
If you have any definite idea I think you ought
to let me know.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want to hide anything, Colonel Colby.
In fact, I’m almost as anxious to find out who set
this fire as you are,” went on Jack, with a little
smile. “But I’d hate to accuse anybody wrongly.
If, however, you insist upon knowing what is in
my mind, I’ll say that the put-put of that engine
sounded to me like the put-put of one of the
Longley Academy boats.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150"></a>[150]</span></p>

<p>“Longley Academy!” exclaimed Colonel Colby
and Captain Dale simultaneously.</p>

<p>“Are you sure of this?” demanded the captain.</p>

<p>“No, I’m not. That’s the reason I didn’t want
to say anything about it.”</p>

<p>“Why should any one from Longley come over
here and want to burn down our boathouse?” demanded
the colonel.</p>

<p>“Maybe they’re sore because they lost those
races,” put in Andy.</p>

<p>“I don’t believe they’d be mean enough to go
as far as that,” said the owner of the institution.
“However, I’ll start an investigation the first thing
in the morning.”</p>

<p>The cadets went back to their quarters and soon
the Rover boys were once more preparing to retire.</p>

<p>“I wonder if Flanders, Halliday and Sands
would be wicked enough to come over here and
start a fire?” questioned Fred.</p>

<p>“I’d hate to accuse anybody of doing that,”
answered Randy.</p>

<p>“Perhaps it was some rascals who have a
grudge against Colonel Colby,” suggested Jack.</p>

<p>“Who could have such a grudge as that?” demanded
Fred. “He treats all his hired help fine.
I don’t know of a single person around Colby<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151"></a>[151]</span>
Hall who doesn’t like the colonel. And all the
tradespeople in town like him too.”</p>

<p>“I wasn’t thinking of the people who work for
him,” answered the young major. “I was thinking
of the fellows who used to be cadets here and
who were fired out—fellows like Werner and
Martell.”</p>

<p>The boys talked the matter over for several
minutes, but could arrive at no conclusion and
finally retired. But it was some time before any
of them got to sleep.</p>

<p>In the morning Colonel Colby, aided by Captain
Dale, started his investigation into the origin
of the fire. A hunt was made up and down the
lake for the mysterious motor-boat, and Captain
Dale even paid a visit to Longley Academy. There
he was received with decided coldness.</p>

<p>“None of our boats were out last night. I am
sure of that,” said the head of the newly organized
military academy. “To think that any of our
cadets would be guilty of setting fire to your boathouse
is ridiculous, Captain Dale.”</p>

<p>“I did not say that they were guilty,” answered
the captain briefly. “We are simply trying to get
at the bottom of this affair. I am sure if one of
your buildings were burned you would like to find
out who did it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152"></a>[152]</span></p>

<p>“I think this is simply a move on Colonel
Colby’s part to bring Longley Academy into disrepute,”
said the master of the institution frigidly.
“It is an outrageous proceeding! I warn you not
to make this matter public. If you do, you may
find yourselves confronting a suit for damages.”</p>

<p>“I am not saying anything in public,” returned
Captain Dale, and a few minutes later took his
departure.</p>

<p>Of course the cadets talked the matter over
freely among themselves. A few thought that
some of their athletic rivals might have committed
the crime, but the majority were of the opinion
that it must have been done by outsiders, and possibly
by those who in years gone by had been
dismissed from the Hall. The actual damage did
not amount to more than two hundred dollars,
and Colonel Colby said he would have the boathouse
repaired just as soon as the present school
term came to an end.</p>

<p>At last, much to the cadets’ satisfaction, the
examinations were at an end. All of the Rovers
and their friends had acquitted themselves creditably,
passing with from ninety-two to ninety-six
per cent. Of the three cadets at the Hall who did
not pass, one was Henry Stowell. But to this
that sneak gave little consideration.</p>

<p>“Why should I break my head to pass when<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>[153]</span>
I’m going to leave Colby Hall for good in a
couple of days?” said Codfish to the few who
would listen to him. “No more of this institution
for me! I’m going to a first-class place this
fall,” and he stuck his nose up in the air.</p>

<p>“We’ll miss you, Codfish,” remarked Andy,
who chanced to hear these words. “We’ll miss
you just like a fellow misses the toothache or a
corn on his toe.”</p>

<p>“Huh! Don’t you talk to me, Andy Rover,”
grumbled Codfish. “I know you!” and then he
hurried away without anything more to say.</p>

<p>It had been decided that the Rovers should
return home for over the Fourth of July, and then
they were to meet Gif and Spouter in Boston for
the journey to Big Bear Lake.</p>

<p>“Good-by to Colby Hall!” cried Randy, when
the term had at last come to an end. “Hurrah
for Big Bear Lake!”</p>

<p>“And hurrah for all the bears we’re going to
shoot!” put in his twin.</p>

<p>“And the fish we’re going to catch!” added
Fred.</p>

<p>“And the jolly times generally we’re going to
have!” finished Jack.</p>

<p>The journey to New York City did not take
long, and at the Grand Central Terminal the boys,
as usual, found their mothers awaiting them with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154"></a>[154]</span>
the family automobiles. There was a good deal
of hugging and kissing, and then all drove up
Fifth Avenue and over to the elegant homes on
Riverside Drive.</p>

<p>“Gee, it’s fine to be home again, Mother!” cried
Fred.</p>

<p>“Yes, Fred. Only you don’t like to stay in it
after you get here,” replied his parent fondly.</p>

<p>“Oh, well, you know a boy has got to be a
boy,” he answered.</p>

<p>That evening there was a grand family party
between the boys and their parents, the girls
having already departed for Valley Brook Farm
with Ruth and May. Dick, Tom and Sam Rover
wanted to know all about how the boys had been
getting along at the school, and then told a little
of how business matters were going with them.</p>

<p>“The oil wells in Texas and Oklahoma are doing
wonderfully well,” said Dick Rover in reply
to a question from his son. “It was the best
work I ever did to go down into those oil fields.”</p>

<p>“How about matters in Wall Street?” questioned
Randy.</p>

<p>“Couldn’t be better, Randy,” responded Tom
Rover. “Everything seems to be coming our way
now.”</p>

<p>“Any more trouble with the Martell crowd?”</p>

<p>“No. Since we got rid of Martell and Brown<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155"></a>[155]</span>
everything has been going along swimmingly,”
replied Tom Rover.</p>

<p>“What are you folks going to do this summer?”
questioned Andy. “Why can’t you come and visit
us while we’re at Big Bear Lake?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps we shall,” answered his Uncle Sam.</p>

<p>“Oh, Dad! that would be fine,” burst out Fred.
“Come up, by all means!”</p>

<p>“Well, we’ll see about that,” answered his
father. “Your mother and your aunts want to go
up to Valley Brook Farm first and stay with the
girls.”</p>

<p>“Oh, bring the whole bunch up to Big Bear
Lake!” cried Jack. It must be confessed though
that when he spoke he was thinking mainly of
Ruth. “Gif says it’s a great big bungalow—in
fact, a small-sized hotel.”</p>

<p>“It used to be used for a fishing club, you
know,” came from Andy. “It would be great
if we could all be up there together just like when
we were out at Big Horn Ranch.”</p>

<p>“Well, that’s something we’ll have to think
over,” said Dick Rover.</p>

<small>ON THE WAY TO BIG BEAR LAKE</small></h2>
</div>


<p>“Off at last for Big Bear Lake!”</p>

<p>“This is the life, boys! We ought to have a
dandy time!”</p>

<p>“Right you are, Fred! Oh, my, what fishing!”</p>

<p>“Yes, and what boating and bathing, Andy!”</p>

<p>“I wonder if Gif and Spouter will be on hand
to meet us?”</p>

<p>“They said so in that telegram I got last night,”
answered Jack.</p>

<p>“Sure, they’ll be on hand,” broke in Randy.
“They never disappointed us yet.”</p>

<p>The four Rover boys were seated in a Pullman
car that was whisking them rapidly toward Boston.
Each had a suitcase with him and numerous
other things to be taken to the camp.</p>

<p>Fourth of July had come and gone with its
usual festivities. In his grip Andy carried an
imitation giant firecracker filled with nothing more
dangerous than collars, neckties and handkerchiefs.
With this giant firecracker he had scared<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157"></a>[157]</span>
several of the servants half to death, thinking he
was going to blow up the kitchen of the house in
which he lived.</p>

<p>It was an ideal summer day and the boys sat
by the windows enjoying the scenery as it rushed
past them. All were in the best of humor.</p>

<p>“This isn’t like going out to Big Horn Ranch,”
said Fred, a bit wistfully. “I’m afraid we’ll miss
the cattle and the cowboys and all that.”</p>

<p>“I’d like to get a crack at a bear,” came from
Fred. “Gee, wouldn’t it be a feather in our cap
to bring down a big fellow!”</p>

<p>“How about it if the bear came along and
brought you down by hugging you to death?”
questioned Jack dryly.</p>

<p>“Pooh! who’s afraid of bears?” answered the
stout young Rover.</p>

<p>The boys had left New York after an early
breakfast and one o’clock found them at the
South Station of the Hub. As they came forth
from the smoky train shed, suitcases and bundles
in hand, Gif and Spouter rushed forward to meet
them.</p>

<p>“Well, I see you’ve got here safe and sound!”
cried Gif.</p>

<p>“Now we can catch the two o’clock train for
Rocky Run,” put in Spouter. “Come ahead. We
can get a couple of taxicabs right outside.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158"></a>[158]</span></p>

<p>“I thought maybe you’d want to stay in Boston
all night and start for Rocky Run in the morning,”
remarked Randy, who had not visited the
Hub many times and who would have liked to
look around the city.</p>

<p>“Oh, come ahead! We want to get to Rocky
Run as soon as we can!” cried Spouter. “Don’t
you say so too, Jack?”</p>

<p>“It’s up to Gif,” answered Jack. “We’re his
guests, you know.”</p>

<p>“Oh, stow that, Jack,” answered Gif quickly.
“We’re going up to Big Bear Lake on an equal
footing. Nobody is to be boss. This is a free-for-all,”
and he gave a happy little laugh.</p>

<p>Having piled into two taxicabs, it did not take
Gif and his guests long to reach the North Station.
Here they procured tickets for Rocky Run
and then found they had still half an hour to wait
for a train.</p>

<p>“Let’s get some books and magazines to take
along and maybe a game or two,” suggested Fred.
“We may want something to read or to play if
we strike bad weather. You know how dull a
week of rain can be in camp.”</p>

<p>The boys procured a number of newspapers
and magazines and some packages of candy, and
in a little while the train for Rocky Run rolled<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159"></a>[159]</span>
into the station. All this while Gif was looking
around anxiously.</p>

<p>“What’s up, Gif? Are you expecting somebody?”
questioned Jack.</p>

<p>“I am. But it looks as if he wasn’t coming,”
answered Gif. “It’s just like him. He’s the
slowest fellow I know. But dad said we might
as well take him along. There’s nothing much
for him to do at home just now.”</p>

<p>“Who are you talking about?”</p>

<p>“I’m talking about Jeff, our hired man. Dad
said we might as well take him up to the bungalow
to do the cooking and some of the other work.”</p>

<p>“Gee! a colored man, eh?” exclaimed Andy.
“We’re to go up there in style!”</p>

<p>“I’d rather not have him along,” answered Gif.
“But dad said we might as well take him and
make him earn his salary. You see the folks are
not at home a great deal, and that doesn’t leave
Jeff much to do.”</p>

<p>As Gif was speaking a tall, ungainly-looking
colored man, wearing a pepper and salt suit and
a light derby hat, shuffled into view, carrying a
valise in one hand and a bundle done up in a
newspaper in the other. As he came closer he
began to smile languidly.</p>

<p>“I’d an awful walk reachin’ here, Mistah Gif,”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160"></a>[160]</span>
he remarked, as he let his bag and bundle drop.
“Awful walk! I got all tangled up in them roundabout
streets. Never did see no streets like these
here ones in Boston.”</p>

<p>“I thought you wouldn’t get here, Jeff,”
answered Gif. “Get aboard. The train is about
to start. Boys, this is Jefferson Adams Lincoln
Wilson, always called Jeff for short. Jeff, this is
Sir Spouter and these are the Mr. Rovers, number
one, two, three and four.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir! Yes, sir!” responded the lanky colored
man, bowing profoundly all around. “Yes,
sir! One, two, three, four! That’s easy, yes,
sir,” and then he followed the boys as they
boarded the train.</p>

<p>“How far is it to Rocky Run?” questioned
Fred, after the crowd had seated themselves with
Jeff just behind them.</p>

<p>“It will take us about four hours to get there
on this train,” answered Gif. “We run as far
as Hammingwood on the main line and then
switch off to Rocky Run.”</p>

<p>“In that case we won’t reach Rocky Run until
almost dark,” answered Jack. “Do you think we
can get to the bungalow to-night?”</p>

<p>“Dad said if we couldn’t we were to ask old
Mose Mumbleton if he couldn’t put us up all
night. He said he was almost certain Mose could<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161"></a>[161]</span>
accommodate us, for he often accommodates fishing
parties.”</p>

<p>“Then that’s all right. We wouldn’t want to
get lost on the lake in the darkness,” put in
Randy.</p>

<p>“Why not? It would be a barrel of fun,”
added his twin carelessly.</p>

<p>“Has Jeff ever been up there?” asked Fred in
a low tone.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes. He’s been up there several times.
That’s one reason dad wanted us to have him
along. He said Jeff could show us where the best
fishing places were and all that sort of thing.
Besides, Jeff has quite a reputation when it comes
to serving fish. That’s his specialty.”</p>

<p>“Well, we’ve got to catch the fish before we
have ’em served,” remarked Jack dryly.</p>

<p>“There’s only one trouble with Jeff. He’s very
lazy, and apt to go to sleep if you give him half
a chance. Otherwise, he isn’t a half bad sort.”</p>

<p>The Rover boys and Spouter soon had evidence
of Jeff’s failing, for the train had been traveling
for less than half an hour when, on glancing back,
the boys saw that Jeff was leaning back in the
seat with eyes closed, evidently sleeping
soundly.</p>

<p>“I’ll bet he isn’t of a worrying disposition,” was
Fred’s comment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162"></a>[162]</span></p>

<p>“I don’t believe he ever worried about anything,”
answered Gif.</p>

<p>“I think I’ll give him a little bit to worry
about,” murmured Andy, tearing a long slip of
transparent paper from one of the candy packages
the boys had purchased. Taking the slip,
Andy rolled it into a long taper with a pointed
end. Then he walked down the aisle and took a
place in a vacant seat directly behind the sleeping
colored man. Reaching over, he began to
tickle Jeff in his ear. The colored man paid no
attention for a few seconds. But then, very
slowly, his hand came up and he brushed his ear.
This operation was repeated several times, and
caused all of the boys to snicker. Then Andy
reached over and tickled Jeff in the nose.</p>

<p>Ker choo! Ker choo! Jeff suddenly awoke
with a start and began to sneeze vigorously. As
he did this, Andy dropped out of sight while
the others pretended to be busy with their papers
and magazines.</p>

<p>“My, my! I must be ketchin’ cold,” murmured
the colored man. “I guess I’d better close that
window,” and he suited the action to the word by
bringing the window down with a bang. Then he
settled himself for another nap.</p>

<p>Again the end of the pointed taper came in contact<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163"></a>[163]</span>
with his ear, and again Jeff slapped not once
but several times at an imaginary fly. Then once
more Andy applied the pointed paper to his nose.</p>

<p>This time the sneezing that followed brought
more results than had been expected. Poor Jeff
bobbed up suddenly, and then his head came down
violently in contact with the seat in front of him.</p>

<p>“My land sakes!” he wailed. “What am the
mattah with my nose?” and then he sneezed again.</p>

<p>“You sure are catching a cold, Jeff. Better
take another seat where there’s less draft,” suggested
Gif.</p>

<p>“I knowed yeste’day I was ketchin’ cold,”
answered the colored man slowly. “I was in the
kitchen at your house workin’ and they had the
window open. I was sure I was goin’ to ketch
cold. I can’t stand no draft nohow,” and he
shuffled away to another seat in the extreme corner
of the car.</p>

<p>“Some fun, Andy, I’ll say,” remarked Randy,
with glistening eyes, as his twin rejoined him.
“I think Jeff is going to give us many a pleasant
time while we’re up at Big Bear Lake.”</p>

<p>“I’ll say so,” was the quick reply.</p>

<p>“You take care that Jeff doesn’t discover what
you’re up to,” admonished Jack. “He may not
like it a bit.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164"></a>[164]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, Jeff is too lazy to notice most things,”
answered Gif. “Just the same, I wouldn’t stir
him up too much,” he added, after a moment’s reflection.</p>

<p>Quickly the afternoon wore away, and a little
after six o’clock the boys arrived at the little
station of Rocky Run. Here they alighted, followed
by Jeff, who had all he could do to carry
his own baggage and did not attempt to assist
any of the others.</p>

<p>The lads found that Rocky Run consisted of
nothing more than half a dozen houses, a general
store and post-office, the railroad station, and
half a dozen boathouses. Over the store was the
sign:</p>

<div class="signage">
<p>MOSES MUMBLETON</p>

<ul>

<li class="blhang"><i>Notary Public</i></li>
<li class="blhang"><i>Boats to Hire</i></li>
<li class="blhang"><i>Orders taken for Cord Wood</i></li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>“Looks as if Mose did a little bit of everything,”
was Jack’s comment, with a grin.</p>

<p>“He’s about the whole shooting match up here,
I guess,” answered Gif. “Come on! Let’s leave<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165"></a>[165]</span>
our baggage here in a heap and go over to the
store.”</p>

<p>With Gif and Jack in advance, the six boys
left the railroad station and walked across a broad
roadway to where the general store was located.
This was in a long and broad two-story wooden
building with a one-story addition in the rear. In
front was a piazza with two steps, a broad double
door, and two show windows filled with various
goods which had evidently been there on exhibition
for some time.</p>

<p>As the boys entered the establishment it was
so dark inside they could for the moment make
out but little. Then they saw an elderly man with
a heavy gray beard leaning on a broad counter in
the rear talking earnestly to two young fellows
who were evidently customers.</p>

<p>“Well, that’s the price,” the man behind the
counter was saying. “I can’t sell those goods for
any less.”</p>

<p>“It’s a fierce price, I’ll say,” remarked one of
the would-be customers.</p>

<p>“We could get those things much cheaper in the
city,” put in the other youth standing at the
counter.</p>

<p>At the sound of the two voices Jack clutched
Gif by the arm.</p>

<p>“What do you know about this, Gif!” he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166"></a>[166]</span>
gasped. “Am I dreaming, or is that really Tommy
Flanders?”</p>

<p>“It’s Flanders all right enough,” answered Gif.
“And Paul Halliday is with him. Now what in
the world brought those two fellows up here?”</p>

<small>ON BIG BEAR LAKE</small></h2>
</div>


<p>As the Colby Hall cadets came closer, Tommy
Flanders and Paul Halliday looked around at
them.</p>

<p>“Hello! what do you know about this?” cried
Flanders.</p>

<p>“What brought you fellows up here?” put in
Halliday.</p>

<p>“Haven’t we a right to be here if we want to?”
questioned Jack coolly. He did not like the tone
of voice in which the boys from Longley Academy
had addressed them.</p>

<p>“Oh, I suppose you have a right to come to Big
Bear Lake,” answered Tommy Flanders. “Just
the same, I don’t give you any credit for following
us.”</p>

<p>“As a matter of fact, we’re not following you,”
retorted Gif. “We didn’t even know you were
here. Have you come to stay?”</p>

<p>“Have we come to stay!” burst out Halliday.
“That’s a good one! You know well enough we
came to stay.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168"></a>[168]</span></p>

<p>“You can’t pull the wool over our eyes,”
growled Flanders. “If you have come up to Big
Bear Lake for a vacation, you simply came to
follow us.”</p>

<p>By this time the others had come into the
general store, adding to the surprise of the cadets
from Longley, who glared at them darkly.</p>

<p>“If it isn’t Tommy Flanders and Paul Halliday!”
burst out Randy. “What do you know
about this!”</p>

<p>“They must be staying up here,” returned
Spouter. “Otherwise it isn’t likely that they
would be at the store.”</p>

<p>“Where are you fellows stopping?” questioned
Halliday, as he approached Fred.</p>

<p>“We’re not stopping anywhere just yet. We
just got off the train,” answered Fred.</p>

<p>“But you’re going to stay at the lake, aren’t
you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, if you want to know.”</p>

<p>“On the east shore?”</p>

<p>“No; on the west shore.”</p>

<p>“Huh! you didn’t dare to come over to where
we are located, did you?” sneered Halliday.</p>

<p>“Then you’re located over on the east shore, are
you?” questioned Gif.</p>

<p>“Of course we are. At the old Willoughby
camp. You know that as well as I do. Why,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169"></a>[169]</span>
half the cadets at Colby Hall knew our bunch was
coming up here.”</p>

<p>“Your bunch?” demanded Jack, with interest.
“How many of you?”</p>

<p>“Ten so far; and three or four others are coming
later.”</p>

<p>“Henry Stowell is coming to-morrow to join
us,” remarked Halliday. “He’s quitting Colby,
you know, and coming to Longley this fall.”</p>

<p>“Well, you’re welcome to Codfish,” announced
Randy quickly.</p>

<p>“Oh, he’s all right if only you didn’t tease him
too much,” answered the youth who had at one
time been Randy’s fellow cadet.</p>

<p>In the midst of the talk two other boys arrived,
Billy Sands and a youth named Ted Maxwell, who
was a captain at Longley. Maxwell was a tall,
quiet fellow and quite gentlemanly in contrast to
his schoolmates.</p>

<p>“Yes, about a dozen or fifteen of us are to
spend the summer at the lake,” said Maxwell to
Jack, as he shook hands. “Ten of us came up
three days ago, and the others are coming the
beginning of next week. We have hired the old
Willoughby place, which, as perhaps you know,
has two little bungalows on it and a little boathouse.
We hope to have a dandy time.”</p>

<p>“We won’t have such a good time if we know<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170"></a>[170]</span>
these fellows are going to be up here,” growled
Halliday.</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know,” answered Ted Maxwell
cheerfully. “We might get up some rowing and
swimming contests and things like that.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t come up here to go into any contests,”
broke in Tommy Flanders. “I came up to take it
easy and have a good time.”</p>

<p>“That’s me, too,” put in Billy Sands. “I’m
just going to take it easy every day.”</p>

<p>“Well, a little exercise won’t hurt anybody,”
answered Maxwell. “I don’t want to go stale,
and neither do you fellows, if any of you expect
to make the football team this fall.”</p>

<p>Maxwell asked the Colby cadets where they
were going to locate, and Gif and the others told
him about the old fishing club bungalow and of
their plans for a grand outing.</p>

<p>“That fishing club outfit is directly across the
lake from our camp,” said Maxwell. “We were
rowing over that way only yesterday.”</p>

<p>“I hope the camp is in good condition,” said
Gif anxiously, wondering if Flanders and his
cronies had visited the place and possibly done
some harm.</p>

<p>“It seemed to be. We didn’t land.”</p>

<p>A few words more followed and then the crowd
from Longley departed, after purchasing a few<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171"></a>[171]</span>
things from Mr. Mumbleton. They moved down
past the railroad station to the lake and there set
off in two rowboats for their camp.</p>

<p>“This is a fine state of affairs,” grumbled Gif.
“I don’t know whether we’ll have a good time
or not with those fellows around.”</p>

<p>“Oh, well, they’ll be on the other side of the
lake,” answered Fred. “How much of a distance
between the two places?”</p>

<p>“The lake is about half a mile wide where our
camp is located, and midway between the two
places there are a number of small islands which
my father used to call the Cat and Kittens.”</p>

<p>Mose Mumbleton had listened with interest to
what all the boys had had to say. Now he shook
hands cordially with Gif, who speedily introduced
the others. In the meantime Jeff had calmly proceeded
to make himself at home on the piazza of
the general store, nodding peacefully as he sat
with his back against one of the posts.</p>

<p>“I thought you might know that Flanders boy,”
said the old storekeeper. “He goes to a military
academy, too.”</p>

<p>“Yes, we know the whole bunch; but we didn’t
know they were coming up here.”</p>

<p>“The folks around here don’t like Mr. Flanders
any too well,” continued the storekeeper. “You
see, Flanders bought the old Micwic factory on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172"></a>[172]</span>
Flat Rock Creek, and they say he is going to
put it in operation again. The bungalow colony
is up in arms against such a move. They don’t
want any factory around here, nor do they want
any factory hands locating along the lake.”</p>

<p>“Where is that factory located?” questioned
Fred.</p>

<p>“It’s just below where those boys have their
camp—about halfway between the camp and this
place,” answered the storekeeper.</p>

<p>“See here,” said Gif, motioning Jack and
Spouter to one side. “Now that we know that
crowd is across the lake from our bungalow,
don’t you think it would be better if we went up
to the camp without further delay? I want to be
certain that they haven’t visited the place and
upset things. I wouldn’t put it past them to do
it. We can come down here to-morrow and get
our supplies. Of course, we could take up a
few things now, just enough for breakfast and
maybe lunch.”</p>

<p>“That suits me,” answered Jack.</p>

<p>“Yes, let’s get to the camp, by all means. I
want to see what kind of place it is,” answered
Spouter.</p>

<p>As a consequence of this, Gif asked the old
storekeeper about their boats.</p>

<p>“I got ’em all ready for you just as soon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173"></a>[173]</span>
as I received your letter,” said Mr. Mumbleton.
“They’re locked up in my boathouse, and I can
get ’em out in a few minutes.”</p>

<p>“Then let us have a few groceries and things
like that and we’ll be off,” returned Gif. “We’ll
come back to-morrow for our regular supplies.
We have a list all made out, and I’ll leave it
with you.”</p>

<p>“Suits me.”</p>

<p>Thereupon the boys obtained some bread,
coffee, sugar, condensed milk, eggs, bacon and a
few other things which were placed in a couple
of empty boxes. Then all went back to the railroad
station for their baggage.</p>

<p>“Here’s a sample of what we can expect from
those other fellows,” growled Andy, as he pointed
to the railroad platform. On their baggage had
been piled some dirty brushwood and leaves.</p>

<p>“Well, let’s be thankful they didn’t do anything
worse,” was Randy’s comment. “They might
have hidden the stuff from us, or something like
that.”</p>

<p>“I guess they didn’t dare!” burst out Jack.
“They knew we’d be after them in a jiffy if they
did anything like that.”</p>

<p>Brushing off the baggage, the boys, followed by
Jeff, made their way to Mose Mumbleton’s boathouse.
The old storekeeper was already on hand<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174"></a>[174]</span>
and had brought forth three rowboats with six
pairs of oars.</p>

<p>“I went over each one of the boats carefully,”
said the storekeeper. “You’ll find ’em in apple-pie
condition.”</p>

<p>“All right. And don’t forget that we’ll be back
to-morrow for our regular supplies,” answered
Gif. “Come on, fellows. It’s getting late and
it’ll be dark before we reach camp.”</p>

<p>Gif was right about the darkness, because the
sun was already sinking behind the forest to the
westward, casting long shadows across the bosom
of Big Bear Lake.</p>

<p>“Wonder if we’ll see any bears on our way up,”
came from Andy, as he took his seat in one of the
boats.</p>

<p>“Sure! we’ll see a dozen of them,” returned
his twin, with a grin. “They’ll all be lined up
on the shore bidding us welcome.”</p>

<p>“Don’t forget, Jeff, you’re to row one of the
boats,” cried Gif gayly.</p>

<p>“Does you want me to row that boat all alone?”
questioned the colored man doubtfully.</p>

<p>“Why, of course! You’re to row the boat
and you are to pull the other two boats, too.”</p>

<p>“What! Me pull the boat all alone and tow
the two other boats too?” questioned Jeff, in consternation.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175"></a>[175]</span>
“I can’t do it, nohow! No man
could!”</p>

<p>“Oh, Gif is only fooling, Jeff,” put in Spouter.
“We can do the rowing just as well as not. We’ll
let you cook supper for us when we land.”</p>

<p>There had been little wind during the day, but
now it seemed to spring up, sighing drearily
through the trees lining the shore. Then the sun
suddenly sank behind a heavy bank of clouds.</p>

<p>“Doesn’t look as if we’d have any moonlight
to-night,” remarked Andy.</p>

<p>“Seems to me we’re going to have quite a
blow,” answered Fred, as he glanced through the
tree-tops at the clouds.</p>

<p>“Come on, fellows! Everybody on the job!”
cried Gif.</p>

<p>He and Fred, along with Jeff, were in the
first boat to get off. Quickly Andy and Jack followed,
and then came Randy and Spouter.</p>

<p>The course lay along the lakeshore and then
past a broad cove where there was a string of
small islands. As they passed the last of these
islands they found the wind increasing and suddenly
saw some whitecaps ahead.</p>

<p>“We’re in for a regular blow!” cried Gif.</p>

<p>“How far have we still to row?” called out
Randy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176"></a>[176]</span></p>

<p>“About a mile.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that isn’t so bad.”</p>

<p>“We’ve got to go slow around here,” called
back Gif. “The lake is shallow and there are
a great number of snags. Don’t hit any of them
and upset.”</p>

<p>As the boys continued to row the wind increased
in violence, and soon whitecaps surrounded
them.</p>

<p>“Maybe we’d bettah pull in closer to shore,”
suggested Jeff, as one of the whitecaps came over
the side of the rowboat, covering them with spray.</p>

<p>“Oh, we’ll head straight for the bungalow,”
answered Gif. “Come on, Fred, bend to it!” and
they began to row with a will and the others followed.</p>

<p>A quarter of a mile more was covered when the
wind seemed suddenly to descend on the three
boats with added violence.</p>

<p>“Gee! we can’t make any headway against this,”
gasped Fred.</p>

<p>“Hadn’t we better turn toward shore?” called
out Andy, from the second boat, which was close
behind.</p>

<p>“Perhaps we’d better,” was the answer. “I
don’t believe this blow will last any great length of
time.”</p>

<p>The third boat had dropped a little behind and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177"></a>[177]</span>
was almost lost to view in the fast-gathering darkness.</p>

<p>“They’re turning to shore,” said Spouter to
Randy. “We might as well do the same thing.”</p>

<p>To turn the craft in that heavy wind was not
easy. A wave came dashing over the side, wetting
them from the knees down. Then the boat whirled
around and all at once slid up on a snag.</p>

<p>“Look out! We’re going over!” cried Spouter,
and the next instant the rowboat upset and he and
Randy were floundering in the lake.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XVII">CHAPTER XVII<br />
<small>TO THE RESCUE</small></h2>
</div>


<p>“Help! Help!” The cry came from Spouter,
who was floundering around in the semi-darkness
of the fast-increasing storm. He had been pitched
overboard so suddenly that he had had no time
in which to protect himself. Consequently he had
scraped his arm on the fallen tree which had
caused the overturning of the rowboat.</p>

<p>“What’s that cry?” came from Gif.</p>

<p>“Somebody calling for help,” answered Andy.
“Look! One of our boats has upset!”</p>

<p>“It’s the boat that had Spouter and Randy in
it,” came from Jack.</p>

<p>“They must have struck one of the snags Gif
told us about,” remarked Fred. “Come! We’d
better turn back and see what’s doing.”</p>

<p>In spite of the violence of the wind and the
whitecaps on the lake none of the others imagined
that Spouter and Randy were in any great danger.
In fact, they were inclined to look at the affair
as a joke. They knew that both of the cadets
who had gone overboard could swim well.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179"></a>[179]</span></p>

<p>“Help! Help!” came again from Spouter.
“Help! Quick!”</p>

<p>“What is it, Spouter?” called back Jack. “Are
you hurt? How about Randy?”</p>

<p>“Randy’s in trouble. He’s caught on a snag!
Come quick!”</p>

<p>“Randy in trouble?” The cry came from
several of the boys, and as quickly as possible
those in the first two boats turned around and
made for the spot where the upsetting had taken
place.</p>

<p>What Spouter had said about Randy was true.
When the boat upset Randy had gone under and
then come to the surface. He had attempted to
strike out for either the boat or the shore, and
had then been caught by a limb of the submerged
tree. Then, because of this and because the boat
was pounding against it, the submerged tree had
in some way turned over, carrying the upper part
of Randy’s body under the surface of the lake.
His feet were in the air, and he was kicking
around vigorously trying to extricate himself
from his perilous position.</p>

<p>It took those in the two remaining boats but
a few seconds to reach the scene of the catastrophe.
They beheld Spouter working frantically,
trying to pull Randy to the surface.</p>

<p>“What is it?” came from Jack.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180"></a>[180]</span></p>

<p>“He’s caught! I can’t bring him up!” gasped
Spouter. “He’s caught on a tree limb, I guess.”</p>

<p>“Shove that boat back!” ordered Gif, and then
reached out with his oar to hold the craft in
check, for the upturned boat was being driven by
the wind directly over the spot where Randy and
Spouter were struggling.</p>

<p>It was certainly a critical moment, and no one
understood it better than did Jack. The tree had
bobbed around, and for a few seconds Randy’s
head had come to the surface, giving him a chance
for fresh air. Then the tree had settled once
more and poor Randy’s head had disappeared as
before. Jack hesitated only an instant, and then
sprang into the lake beside Spouter.</p>

<p>“What is it, Spouter? Can you make out?”
he questioned quickly. “Is his arm or part of his
body caught, or is it only his clothing?”</p>

<p>“It’s his arm. It’s twisted around one of the
tree limbs,” gasped the other.</p>

<p>Taking a deep breath, Jack allowed himself to
sink down. He felt around in the darkness under
water and found Randy’s free arm. The boy was
doing his best to liberate the other arm, which
was held tightly in a crotch of the submerged
tree. Close beside the limb was a sharp rock,
and the force of the overturning tree was holding
Randy against this.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181"></a>[181]</span></p>

<p>“I’ve got to get him out somehow,” thought
the young major, and, pressing himself against
the rock, he pushed with all his might on the
tree limb, trying to force it back. Then he gave
his cousin’s body a shove. Then, unable to hold
his breath longer, he came to the surface.</p>

<p>As Jack did this the body of Randy appeared
two yards away. He was all but overcome when
Spouter went to the rescue, followed by Fred.
Between them they managed to hoist the gasping
youth into one of the boats. Then they got into
another craft, and Jack did likewise.</p>

<p>By this time the wind was blowing more furiously
than ever and the cadets found it all they
could do to get to shore. Fortunately they found
a small inlet where, among the bushes, it was
comparatively quiet. In the meanwhile the upturned
boat drifted away and was lost to sight
in the darkness.</p>

<p>“Is Randy all right?” questioned Gif anxiously,
flashing a searchlight he carried.</p>

<p>“He’s pretty well used up,” returned Fred.
“But I think he’ll come around.”</p>

<p>An instant later Randy gave a deep gasp and
then opened his eyes. Then he commenced to
cough and presently sat up.</p>

<p>By this time it had begun to rain and the boys
could see that they were in for a sudden summer<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182"></a>[182]</span>
storm. At first the rain came down gently, but
soon there was a heavy downpour and all were
glad to seek the shelter of some overhanging
trees.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile several of the boys did what
they could for poor Randy. He felt rather weak
from his thrilling experience, and had little to say.
But they knew he would get over it, and for this
they were exceedingly thankful.</p>

<p>“Gee! if he’d been drowned I don’t know what
we should have done,” Jack said, with a shudder.</p>

<p>“Please don’t mention it, Jack!” returned Andy.
“If anything like that had happened to Randy I’d
never have been able to go home and face mother
and father.”</p>

<p>“It shows how careful we’ve got to be when
we’re out on this lake,” came from Fred. “Gif
warned us about those snags.”</p>

<p>“This is the only part of the lake where those
snags exist,” said Gif. “The rest of the lake is
perfectly clear and deep enough for any ordinary
boat. Father used to warn us against coming up
along this shore. He always said it was much
safer to go outside, even if one rowed around
some of those islands.”</p>

<p>“And I’ll say your father was right!” returned
Spouter. “I think if we’d taken the outside route
we’d have been perfectly safe even in the wind.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183"></a>[183]</span></p>

<p>“If you young gen’lemen wants to walk to the
bungalow there’s a path through the woods jest
behind here,” announced Jeff presently. The accident
had scared him very much. “Of course it
would be a wet walk, but you could make it. It
ain’t more’n a mile at the most.”</p>

<p>“Well, we’ll either have to do that or else stay
here all night,” said Gif.</p>

<p>“What about that lost boat?” questioned Jack.</p>

<p>“We can’t do anything about that in the wind
and the darkness, Jack. We’ll have to wait until
the storm is over and it grows light.”</p>

<p>“And what about my suitcase and that one
belonging to Randy? They both went overboard
when the boat upset,” put in Spouter mournfully.</p>

<p>“Maybe we can fish them up if the lake isn’t
too deep,” suggested Fred. “But we’ll want to
do it in good weather and when it is light. We
don’t want to take any more chances with those
snags.”</p>

<p>“What about you, Randy? Do you think you
can walk to the bungalow?” questioned Jack
kindly.</p>

<p>“I can try,” was the brave response. “I think
I can walk part of the way, anyhow.”</p>

<p>“We can carry you the rest of the way if we
have to,” answered Jack. “In fact, I can start
to carry you right now,” he added.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184"></a>[184]</span></p>

<p>But Randy would not submit to this, and so
the whole crowd started off through the woods
on foot, Jeff and Gif leading the way. They
carried their suitcases with them, but left the
bundles behind.</p>

<p>By the aid of the searchlight it was comparatively
easy to find the path through the woods,
and once on this they found walking not so bad.
Toward the end of the journey Randy lagged a
little, and thereupon Jack insisted that his cousin
get on his back.</p>

<p>When they finally reached the bungalow they
found the long, low, one-story building in absolute
darkness. The front door had two padlocks
upon it, and Gif produced the keys given to him
by his father and unlocked the portal and threw
it open. Then he threw the rays of the searchlight
into the living room. At once came a scurry
of little feet and then several dark objects scuttled
through an open doorway toward the rear of the
building.</p>

<p>“What were they?” questioned Spouter quickly.</p>

<p>“I don’t know. Either rats or squirrels. Anyway,
they’re gone,” answered Gif. “Come on in
out of the rain,” for the wind was blowing the
rain well under the wide porch of the bungalow.</p>

<p>By the illumination afforded by the flashlight
the boys could see that the living room of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185"></a>[185]</span>
bungalow was plainly but neatly furnished with
a big square table, several chairs and two long
benches. To one side was a large fireplace on
which some wood had been placed ready for
lighting.</p>

<p>“We’ll soon have this place looking more comfortable,”
said Gif. “We’ll get a good fire started,
and then we can dry our clothing. In the meantime
Jeff can go into the kitchen and stir things
up there.”</p>

<p>“How are you going to get a meal with the
grub left behind?” questioned Andy.</p>

<p>“Oh, there’s always something of some sort
here, isn’t there, Jeff?”</p>

<p>“Was last time I was here,” answered the colored
man. “We always left some stuff in the tin
canisters and in some glass jars, so that the mice
and rats and squirrels couldn’t get at ’em.”</p>

<p>Two lamps were lit, and then they lighted the
fire in the big chimneyplace. Soon the flames
were roaring merrily, and then the lads began to
take off some of their clothing. Randy was glad
to disrobe and wrap himself in a blanket from
one of the beds.</p>

<p>“I can’t help but think how close I was to
drowning,” he whispered to Fred. “It makes me
shiver every time I think of it!”</p>

<p>“Don’t mention it!” was the reply. “We’ve<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186"></a>[186]</span>
got to be awfully careful after this, Randy.”</p>

<p>“You bet!”</p>

<p>As soon as his guests had been made as comfortable
as circumstances permitted in the living
room, Gif went out into the kitchen to learn
what Jeff was doing. He found the colored man
building a fire in an old-fashioned cookstove
which had been in use in the bungalow for many
years.</p>

<p>“Ain’t very much to eat, I’ll tell you that,”
said the colored man. “Got a little coffee and
sugar and some canned corn and some sardines.”</p>

<p>“Well, I brought a big loaf of bread along and
some crackers from that box we had,” answered
Gif. “We’ll have to make out somehow. It’s
better than nothing. I’m thinking the storm will
clear away by morning, and if it does we can
get out early and rescue that stuff we left behind.”</p>

<p>“Ain’t no way to do,” grumbled Jeff. “We
ought to’ve stayed down to Mr. Mumbleton’s
place. If we’d have done that there wouldn’t
have been no accident nor nothin’.”</p>

<p>“Well, we’re here, and we’ve got to make the
best of it, Jeff,” answered Gif briefly. He was
by no means pleased to think that the colored
man had been “wished on them” by his father.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187"></a>[187]</span></p>

<p>Gif returned to the living room, leaving Jeff
to prepare the evening meal as best he could. He
proceeded to take off more of his garments, hanging
them where they might dry before the open
fire. In the meanwhile all could hear the wind
sighing mournfully through the trees that surrounded
the big bungalow and hear the rain coming
down on the roof as steadily as ever.</p>

<p>“Well, we’re much better off here than if we
had stayed in the woods, that’s sure,” said Jack,
as he stretched out on a bench in front of the fire.
“This will be fine when once we get settled and
have everything to work with.”</p>

<p>“I wonder if those other fellows got back to
the Willoughby camp,” mused Fred.</p>

<p>“I don’t see why not. They started long
before we did, and they don’t have any snags on
that side of the lake,” answered Gif.</p>

<p>The boys could hear Jeff moving around the
kitchen and they heard the clatter of kettles and
pans as the colored man was preparing the evening
meal. Then, of a sudden, they heard Jeff let
out a wild yell.</p>

<p>“Hi! Hi! I’s killed! I’s killed!” roared the
colored man. “Save me! Save me! I’s killed!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XVIII">CHAPTER XVIII<br />
<small>AT THE BUNGALOW</small></h2>
</div>


<p>The uproar in the kitchen was so terrific that
all the boys in the living room of the bungalow
leaped to their feet in alarm.</p>

<p>“I’s killed! I’s killed!” roared Jeff. “I’s stung
to death!” and, with a clattering of a kettle on
the floor, the colored man came dashing into the
living room flourishing a frying pan in one hand.</p>

<p>“What is it, Jeff? What has happened?” questioned
Gif.</p>

<p>“It’s a snake! A great big long snake! Right
on the shelf over the stove!” wailed Jeff. He
dropped the frying pan on the floor. “He done
stung me on the hand and on the arm! I’s a dead
man!” and he began to moan pitifully.</p>

<p>“What kind of a snake was it, Jeff?”</p>

<p>“Did he rattle?”</p>

<p>“Was it a blacksnake?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know what he was! He was behind
some old newspapers and magazines! I done put
my hand up there to get down a salt-shaker and he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189"></a>[189]</span>
pushed his head out and stung me—stung me
twice, right on the hand and on the wrist. I’s
a dead man! Somebody run for a doctor. If I
don’t gets a doctor I’ll be dead before mornin’,”
and Jeff began to move around the living room,
swinging his injured hand and moaning and
groaning loudly.</p>

<p>Of course all of the boys were alarmed. They
had had several adventures with snakes, some of
them poisonous, and they knew that all that Jeff
said might be true. On the other hand, they
realized that the snake might be almost harmless.</p>

<p>Although they had left a large part of their
luggage behind when starting on the walk
through the woods, they had brought with them
a shotgun and a pistol. Grabbing up the shotgun,
Jack walked to the kitchen door.</p>

<p>“Flash your light in, Gif,” he said, for the
illumination made by the kerosene lamp in the
kitchen was rather dim. “If that snake is still
on the shelf a dose of shot at such close quarters
will soon finish him.”</p>

<p>With caution the two boys advanced into the
kitchen of the bungalow. At first Gif flashed
the light all over the floor, and especially in the
corners.</p>

<p>“What about that thing over there, Jack?” he
exclaimed suddenly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190"></a>[190]</span></p>

<p>“Only a dirty dishcloth,” answered the Rover
boy.</p>

<p>Having made sure that no snake was lurking
on the floor of the kitchen, Gif picked up a
broom that was handy.</p>

<p>“I’ll shove the stuff off the shelf with this,”
he said. “If you see anything of the snake, blaze
away.”</p>

<p>“I sure will,” answered Jack, raising the
double-barreled shotgun and placing his finger
on one of the triggers.</p>

<p>The others had crowded to the doorway to see
what was taking place, leaving Jeff still moaning
and groaning in the living room. The colored
man was sure that he was going to die—that
he had been poisoned.</p>

<p>Holding up the searchlight so that the rays
fell full upon the kitchen shelf, Gif elevated the
end of the broom, and then, with a quick motion,
sent the newspapers and magazines flying to the
floor at one side of the stove.</p>

<p>As the mass of reading matter came down
some dirt and a small wiggling object not over
two feet long came with it. Jack was ready
to fire, but suddenly thought better of it and,
leaping forward, placed his foot on the object.</p>

<p>“Just a plain little garter snake,” he said, with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191"></a>[191]</span>
a laugh. “If I had shot it there wouldn’t have
been enough left to show Jeff.”</p>

<p>“Maybe the big snake is among the papers,”
suggested Fred, who stood just behind Gif.</p>

<p>“We’ll soon see,” returned Gif, and with the
broom he scattered the papers and magazines in
every direction and with it a quantity of dust
and cobwebs. But nothing in the way of a
reptile appeared.</p>

<p>“Here, give me that snake,” said Gif, after
they had looked around the floor carefully. And
catching the little reptile by the tail he snapped
it into the air, almost severing the head from
the body. Then, still holding the snake, he went
into the other room.</p>

<p>“Here’s the thing that stung you, Jeff,” he said
coolly. “Those stings won’t hurt you any more
than the sting from a good big mosquito. You
ought to be ashamed of yourself for getting so
scared over nothing,” he added, a bit more
sternly.</p>

<p>Jeff was crouched before the fire, rocking to
and fro and moaning. Now he looked up with
staring eyes at the little snake Gif was holding.</p>

<p>“Tha—tha—that ain’t the snake what stung
me,” he faltered.</p>

<p>“Yes, it is, Jeff. We just got it out of that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192"></a>[192]</span>
bunch of papers on the shelf. There isn’t another
snake anywhere around. How this little thing
got in and on the shelf, I don’t know. Must
have crawled in through some little hole in the
floor or the wall.”</p>

<p>“I—I—I’m certain sure it was a big snake what
stung me,” mumbled the colored man.</p>

<p>“Oh, Jeff, you’re full of tacks!” answered Jack.
“Go on back into the kitchen and look for yourself.”</p>

<p>“A little snake like that couldn’t harm anybody,”
came from Andy. “Why, a hundred of
’em wouldn’t be any worse than a bunch of
mosquitoes!”</p>

<p>Jeff looked rather sheepish. He examined his
hand and his wrist, and then moved rather slowly
toward the kitchen.</p>

<p>“I never did like no snakes,” he said. “I
had a cousin once down South got bit by a
moccasin and he didn’t live no time at all. When
snakes is dangerous they’s dangerous, and I don’t
want none of ’em around me.”</p>

<p>“If you’re afraid to go into the kitchen and
get us something to eat, I’ll go in there myself,”
said Gif sharply.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’s goin’! I’s goin’!” answered the colored
man hastily. “We’ll have supper in a few
minutes. Ain’t much to cook, as I done told<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193"></a>[193]</span>
you before.” Then he resumed his preparations
for the repast.</p>

<p>Even when it was ready the supper did not
amount to a great deal. However, the boys
managed to make it do, and, thoroughly tired
out, were glad enough to go to bed early.</p>

<p>As Gif had told them, the bungalow was a low,
rambling affair. On each side of the big living
room were three bedrooms and there were more
bedrooms in the rear. Behind the bungalow was
a long, low shed which, Gif explained, had occasionally
been used for “the overflow” of visitors
to the fishing club resort.</p>

<p>The boys decided that they would bunk together,
two in a room, thus occupying two rooms
on one side of the big living apartment and one
room on the other. Jeff was to use a small room
directly off of the kitchen.</p>

<p>“I’s goin’ to make sure there ain’t no snakes
in my bed,” he announced when getting ready to
retire.</p>

<p>The two fires had dried out the bungalow
thoroughly, and, utterly worn out with their day’s
exertions, the Rover boys and their chums slept
soundly until nearly eight o’clock the next morning.
When they arose they found that the storm
had cleared away and that the sun was shining
as brightly as ever.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194"></a>[194]</span></p>

<p>“This is something like!” declared Fred, as
he went out on the porch of the bungalow and
stretched himself. “My, what a pretty view!”</p>

<p>It was all of that, and the other boys came
out to gaze upon the scene before they finished
their toilets. They could look up and down the
long lake for miles. In front of them were the
pretty little islands known as the Cat and Kittens,
all covered thickly with brushwood.</p>

<p>“If it wasn’t for the islands we could look
right over to the Willoughby camp,” said Gif.
“It’s right in that direction,” and he pointed with
his hand.</p>

<p>“Looks to me as if we were going to have
rival camps,” was Jack’s comment.</p>

<p>“I hope those Longley fellows keep their distance,”
came from Fred. “We didn’t come up
here to have our outing spoiled by Flanders,
Sands and that bunch.”</p>

<p>There was very little to eat for breakfast, and
this being so, the lads resolved to go back along
the path through the woods without delay and
bring in the remainder of their luggage and
other stuff left behind.</p>

<p>“You can come with us, Jeff,” said Gif. “I
want you to help us with the boxes of provisions.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you want me to stay at the bungalow<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195"></a>[195]</span>
and clean up a little?” asked the colored man,
who had no desire for anything in the way of
strenuous work.</p>

<p>“No, you come along. You can clean up after
we get back.”</p>

<p>“Have you a long boathook handy, Gif?” asked
Spouter. “You know, Randy and I want to
rescue our handbags if we can.”</p>

<p>“Sure! We’ll take a couple of them along,”
was the answer.</p>

<p>It did not take the party long to reach the
place where the two rowboats and their supplies
had been left. They had covered the supplies
with a raincoat and with some tree branches,
and now found them in fairly good condition.</p>

<p>“What do you say, Fred, if you and I go back
with Jeff and carry all we can,” said Gif to the
stout young Rover. “Jack and Andy can help
Spouter and Randy look for the lost baggage
and the missing rowboat. Then, when they get
back, we’ll have a good meal ready for them.”</p>

<p>“Suits me,” said Fred, and in a little while
he and Gif set off in company with Jeff, each
loaded down with all he could carry. This work
did not suit the colored man at all, but Gif paid
scant attention to his grumbling.</p>

<p>The other boys found it no easy task to locate
the missing suitcases. They paddled around in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196"></a>[196]</span>
both boats for the best part of a quarter of an
hour without success. Then Jack suggested that
he undress and look around as best he could
under water.</p>

<p>“Well, you take care that you don’t get stuck
the same as I was,” said Randy.</p>

<p>“I’ll be careful, don’t fear,” was Jack’s
answer. “I’ll take one of the poles down with
me.”</p>

<p>He was soon in the water, and after diving
several times managed to locate Spouter’s baggage
and fasten it to the boathook. Then
this was hoisted up, and Jack went down again,
and after another long search found the rest of
the baggage.</p>

<p>“That’s fine, Jack!” said Randy, when his
suitcase came up. “I suppose everything will be
soaked, but I don’t know of much in there that
the water will hurt.”</p>

<p>“You’ll certainly have to do over your neckties,
and maybe your shirts,” said Andy, with a
grin.</p>

<p>“Oh, well, a little thing like that doesn’t count,”
answered his cousin.</p>

<p>Having recovered the things from the bottom
of the lake, the four boys set out on a search
for the missing rowboat.</p>

<p>“The wind was blowing toward the east shore,”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197"></a>[197]</span>
said Jack. “Maybe we’ll find it along there
somewhere under the overhanging bushes.”</p>

<p>They pulled around in one of the boats for the
best part of half an hour, but without sighting
the missing craft. By this time the sun was
mounting in the sky and they were beginning to
feel hungry.</p>

<p>“Guess we’d better get the other boat and go
back to the bungalow and come out again after
we’ve had something to eat,” suggested Spouter.
“It may take a whole day or more to locate that
missing boat.”</p>

<p>They were about to turn toward the other shore
of Great Bear Lake when they saw a rowboat
coming out of a cove just below them. The
rowboat contained four young fellows, two of
whom were rowing and the others taking it easy
in the bow and stern.</p>

<p>“Must be some of the fellows from the Longley
camp!” exclaimed Spouter.</p>

<p>“More than likely,” answered Jack. And
then, as the distant boat swung further out of
the cove, he added: “And look! They’re dragging
an empty rowboat behind them!”</p>

<small>A QUARREL OVER A ROWBOAT</small></h2>
</div>


<p>“That’s our boat!”</p>

<p>“I think so myself. Come on. Let’s row
over to them before they have a chance to reach
their camp!” cried Jack.</p>

<p>“That’s the talk!” returned Spouter.</p>

<p>“I wonder if they got the oars,” said Randy.
“The pair I was using was dandy.”</p>

<p>“It isn’t likely,” answered Andy. “You let
them fall overboard, didn’t you, when the boat
upset?”</p>

<p>“Sure! Everything went out, as far as I
know.”</p>

<p>With each cadet at an oar, the four lads sent
the rowboat through the water with good speed,
and in less than five minutes were hauling up
alongside of the other craft. Those at the oars
proved to be Tommy Flanders and Billy Sands.
The fellow in the stern, who was smoking a
cigarette, was Paul Halliday, while the fourth lad
was a stranger to the boys from Colby Hall,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199"></a>[199]</span>
although they had seen him in the Longley contingent
at the ball games.</p>

<p>“Hello! So you found our boat, did you?”
exclaimed Spouter.</p>

<p>“Your boat?” demanded Tommy Flanders.
“Who said it was your boat?”</p>

<p>“I say it,” answered Randy. “That boat got
away from us yesterday in the storm.”</p>

<p>“Did you find the oars?” questioned Jack.</p>

<p>“No. We didn’t find anything but the boat,”
said Halliday. “And you’ve got to prove it’s
your property before we give it up,” he went on
suddenly and with a wink at his companions.</p>

<p>“That boat belongs to Mr. Garrison,” declared
Jack. “We got it from Mose Mumbleton only
yesterday.”</p>

<p>“Well, you’ll have to prove that before we give
it up,” came from Tommy Flanders. “Don’t you
say so, fellows?”</p>

<p>“Sure we do,” put in Billy Sands readily.</p>

<p>“Of course if it’s their boat they ought to
have it,” came somewhat slowly from the fourth
boy.</p>

<p>“Nothing doing, Fiddler!” cried Halliday.
“We wouldn’t take their word for anything.
We’re going to take this boat to our camp and
they can’t have it until they prove it belongs to
them. For all we know, they saw us pick the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200"></a>[200]</span>
boat up and now want a chance to get it for
themselves, even if it doesn’t belong to them.”</p>

<p>“Halliday, you ought to be punched for that!”
cried Randy angrily.</p>

<p>“You know well enough we wouldn’t claim
the boat if it wasn’t ours,” added his brother.</p>

<p>“I don’t know anything about it. If this boat
belongs to Mr. Garrison he’s got to prove property.
Besides that, he ought to pay for having
it brought back. If it hadn’t been for us the boat
might never have been found.”</p>

<p>“Oh, so you’re out for a reward, are you?”
remarked Spouter sarcastically. “How much do
you think you ought to have—a quarter or fifty
cents?”</p>

<p>“I don’t want any of your funny talk, Powell,”
roared Halliday, in a rage. “I’m not looking for
any reward, nor am I going to turn this boat over
to somebody it doesn’t belong to.”</p>

<p>“There is the name on the stern!” cried Randy.
“<em>Comet!</em> That’s the name of the boat we were
in yesterday when we got upset on a snag. That’s
our boat, and no question about it.”</p>

<p>“Well, we’re going to take the boat to our
camp. If Mr. Garrison wants the boat and can
prove it belongs to him, let him come over there,”
said Tommy Flanders, after a few whispered<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201"></a>[201]</span>
words to his cronies. Then those in the other
boat began to row away.</p>

<p>“Great tomcats! we’re not going to let them
get away with our boat, are we?” gasped Andy.
“Why, I’d fight ’em first!”</p>

<p>“So would I,” declared Spouter. “That boat
belongs to us, and they know it as well as we do.
It’s only a trick to keep us from having the use
of the craft.”</p>

<p>“Let’s pull after them and cut the boat adrift,”
said Jack. “Andy, you get in the stern and have
your knife ready. We’ll show those fellows a
trick or two.”</p>

<p>“Right-o,” answered his cousin, and without
letting those in the other craft see what they
were doing Andy got out his pocketknife and
opened the largest of the blades. The others fell
to rowing, and in a few seconds more were alongside
of the rowboat which was being towed.</p>

<p>“Hi! Let go of that!” cried Billy Sands suddenly,
and, reaching out over the stern, he tried
to pull the second boat closer.</p>

<p>Andy, however, was too quick for Sands, and
in a twinkling he reached over and cut the line.
The loose end he caught in his hand and in a
moment more the empty rowboat was tied fast
to the stern of the craft occupied by the Rovers<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202"></a>[202]</span>
and Spouter. Then Andy dropped back in his
seat and grabbed his oar.</p>

<p>“Away we go, boys!” he chuckled. “I don’t
believe they can catch us even if we have got to
drag the other boat behind us.”</p>

<p>“Stop! Stop!” roared Tommy Flanders. “Stop,
or we’ll have the law on you!”</p>

<p>“You go to grass, Flanders,” answered Andy.</p>

<p>“Don’t you dare to follow us,” called back
Spouter. “If you do you’ll be sorry for it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, let ’em go. It’s probably their boat, anyhow,”
said the boy who had been called Fiddler,
in a low tone. “We don’t want that boat. We’ve
got all the boats we need.”</p>

<p>There was a hot argument between this boy
and the others from Longley Academy, and while
this was going on the Rovers and Spouter pulled
steadily and soon placed quite a distance between
themselves and the other craft. Then, looking
back, they saw Tommy Flanders and his crowd
take up their oars again and row in the direction
of Willoughby camp.</p>

<p>“What a nerve they had!” remarked Randy,
as he and the others let up a little in their rowing.</p>

<p>“I’ll bet if we hadn’t spotted them they would
never have said a word about the rowboat. That
is, if they found out we had lost it,” came from
Jack.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203"></a>[203]</span></p>

<p>“Just shows how mean that bunch is,” declared
Andy.</p>

<p>“They’ll be meaner than ever after this, Andy.
They’ll want to square up with us for getting the
best of them in this affair.”</p>

<p>As the other boat was now well on its way
to the camp on the east shore of Big Bear Lake,
the boys from Colby Hall determined to turn
back once more and take a look around for the
missing oars. This they did, and spent an hour
in rowing slowly up and down the shore and
around several small islands. They were rewarded
by finding two of the oars. What had
become of the other pair was a mystery.</p>

<p>It was well toward noon when they got back
to camp, and it must be confessed that their arms
were tired and they were glad to rest a bit before
partaking of the dinner prepared by Jeff under
the directions and with the aid of Gif and Fred.</p>

<p>“What gall those fellows had,” remarked Fred,
when he heard the story the others had to tell.</p>

<p>“If they had kept that boat my father could
have made it hot for them,” remarked Gif.</p>

<p>“Oh, they wouldn’t dare to keep it. They only
thought they were going to make us a lot of
trouble,” answered Jack. “It was just a little
meanness on their part, that’s all.”</p>

<p>All the boxes and bundles had been brought in;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204"></a>[204]</span>
and as soon as they had rested and had dinner
Randy and Spouter set about emptying their suitcases
and drying out their contents. Fortunately,
nothing had been permanently injured, for which
the lads were thankful.</p>

<p>Several days passed, the boys doing little except
to go in bathing and lie around outdoors
enjoying themselves. The bungalow boasted of
several hammocks, and these were stretched between
convenient trees, some of them quite close
to the water. The lads went fishing, catching a
fine mess of pickerel and perch, which they had
Jeff fry for supper and for the following breakfast.</p>

<p>“Well, Jeff certainly knows how to fry fish,”
remarked Jack, after he had eaten his supper. “I
never ate fish that tasted better.”</p>

<p>“That’s the one thing that Jeff can do,”
answered Gif. “Otherwise, I think he’s about as
lazy and worthless as any nigger I ever met.
Privately, I wish we could get rid of him.”</p>

<p>“You’d better pile more work on him, Gif.
Maybe then he’d get tired of the job and make
an excuse for going home,” suggested Spouter.</p>

<p>“I’m certainly going to do something unless he
wakes up,” answered the other.</p>

<p>On Monday, following a quiet Sunday in camp,
all the boys rowed up to Rocky Run to purchase<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205"></a>[205]</span>
some additional supplies from Mose
Mumbleton. The old storekeeper was glad to
see them and had some news to impart.</p>

<p>“Three more young fellows came for that other
camp yesterday,” he said. “A fellow named
Smith, another named Mason and a third chap
with a big wide mouth, named Stowell.”</p>

<p>“That was Codfish!” exclaimed Andy. “They
said he was coming up here.”</p>

<p>“Did they buy anything from you, Mr.
Mumbleton?” questioned Jack.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes; a few things. But most of those
fellows are terribly sharp at driving a bargain.
I guess they haven’t got any too much spending
money with them. Another thing! Mr. Flanders
was up here. He has a boy over to the camp.
He’s the man, you know, who bought that factory
up on Flat Rock Creek.”</p>

<p>“Is he staying up at the camp?” asked Andy.</p>

<p>“Oh, no. He was going up to a farmhouse
that’s quite close to the old factory. I think he
wants to look the property over. He’s thinking
of opening it up again, you know.”</p>

<p>“What sort of factory is it?” questioned Fred.</p>

<p>“Why, it used to be a paint works. What
they’re going to do with it now though, I don’t
know. It’s a pretty good building, and I suppose
it could be used for most anything.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206"></a>[206]</span></p>

<p>After the storekeeper had supplied them with
the things they wanted he told them they had
better hang around a little longer as the train
would soon be in with the mail. They waited
as directed and were rewarded with a number of
letters which, of course, they read eagerly.</p>

<p>One communication received by Jack was from
Ruth. In it the girl declared that she was having
a fine time with the other girls at Valley Brook
Farm, but that she was very much worried over
her father’s business affairs.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The loss of the book of formulas is worrying
dad a great deal,” she wrote. “Not only because
he spent so much money on it, but because he got
some of the money from Uncle Barney and because
he signed an agreement to purchase a place
where he could manufacture those artists’ colors.
And worst of all, the loss of the money seems to
have revived that old quarrel between dad and
Uncle Barney. Mother is terribly worried, especially
as dad doesn’t seem to be nearly as well
as he was before that aeroplane accident.”</p>
</div>

<p>The reading of this communication worried
Jack not a little. He could see that Ruth was
much downcast over the state of affairs.</p>

<p>“Everything all right, Jack?” questioned Fred.
“Here’s a letter from dad if you’d like to read
it. Everything is O. K. down their way.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207"></a>[207]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, they’re all well enough up at the farm,”
answered the young major. “But Ruth has her
troubles,” and then he told of what the girl had
written.</p>

<p>“It’s too bad,” remarked his cousin. “I wonder
why Mr. Stevenson doesn’t try to get on the
track of those two men, Norris and Lemrech, the
workmen who were interested in getting such
formulas. Don’t you remember they said Lemrech
was of a shady reputation and not above
stealing the formulas and that the other fellow,
who was his cousin, was the same kind of man?”</p>

<p>“Well, Mr. Stevenson is probably trying to
locate those fellows. But maybe they know
enough to keep out of sight.”</p>

<p>“If he shouldn’t get the formulas back, Jack,
it might bankrupt him.”</p>

<p>“That’s just what I have been thinking,”
answered the young major soberly.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XX">CHAPTER XX<br />
<small>AT THE RIVAL CAMP</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Several days passed and the Rover boys and
their chums began to feel thoroughly at home in
the camp at Big Bear Lake. The weather since
the storm when they had arrived had been ideal,
and they slept with all the doors and windows
wide open. This aired the bungalow thoroughly.</p>

<p>Because of Jeff’s constant worrying concerning
snakes they had made a thorough search in and
around the bungalow for such reptiles. Their
only discovery was a nest of half a dozen garter
snakes, not one of them over two feet long, under
some rocks near the shed behind the house.</p>

<p>“I half wish we could find a snake three or
four feet long and scare Jeff almost to death,”
grumbled Gif. “Then maybe he’d pack up and
go home.”</p>

<p>“What a pity I didn’t bring that paper snake
along—the one we used to scare Codfish with,”
answered Andy. “I might try that big imitation<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209"></a>[209]</span>
firecracker on him, only he saw it the other day
and saw that I was using it for a collar and
necktie box.”</p>

<p>During those days the boys went in swimming
several times. They even got up a little race
among themselves, which Jack won with ease,
Spouter and Randy being tied for second place.
They saw but little of the cadets at the Willoughby
camp. Once they noticed several rowboats going
in the direction of Beldane at the lower end of
the lake, and with the aid of the fieldglasses Gif
had brought along recognized some of the occupants.</p>

<p>“I guess they’re going down there for their
supplies instead of getting them of Mose Mumbleton,”
was Jack’s comment. “I suppose they have
an idea that Mumbleton is a special friend of
yours, Gif, and that’s why some of those fellows,
especially Flanders and his bunch, don’t want to
trade with him.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m sorry to have Mumbleton lose the
money,” answered Gif.</p>

<p>“Oh, he won’t lose very much,” put in Randy.
“Don’t you remember he said they were very close
at driving a bargain for what they wanted? They
would probably like to have him sell his goods
without any profit.”</p>

<p>“I’d like to have a look at their camp,” said<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210"></a>[210]</span>
Andy. “What’s the matter with rowing over
to that side of the lake to-morrow?”</p>

<p>The others were willing, and they left directly
after lunch on the following day, Gif first instructing
Jeff as to what he was to do during
their absence.</p>

<p>“I want you to clean up the living room thoroughly,
Jeff,” said he. “And then I want you
to get a first-class dinner ready for us. We’ll
be back about six o’clock. Have those fish we
caught this morning and some fried potatoes,
corn, and see if you can’t turn out some kind of
nice cake or a pie. There are plenty of apples
on hand for a pie.”</p>

<p>“All right, I’ll ’tend to everything,” mumbled
the colored man, but he looked anything but
pleased at the prospect. He had come to the camp
hoping that the boys would do most of the work
and that he could take it easy.</p>

<p>One of the rowboats was considerably larger
than the others, and the six boys piled into this,
taking two pairs of oars with them.</p>

<p>“We can take turns at rowing,” said Gif.
“That will give each fellow a chance to rest. We
can take our own time, too, because it isn’t so
very much of a trip.”</p>

<p>“Let’s row in and out among the Cat and Kittens,”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211"></a>[211]</span>
suggested Jack. “I’ve been wanting to
land on those islands ever since we came to the
bungalow.”</p>

<p>“You won’t find much of a landing place,
Jack. Every one of the islands is covered with
brushwood to the water’s edge, as you can see.”</p>

<p>The boys rowed around the larger island and
then in and out among the four which were
smaller. As Gif had said, they found each of
them heavily wooded and did not see a single
place where a good landing could be made.</p>

<p>“If anybody wanted to build on any of these
islands he’d have a job clearing the ground,” was
Spouter’s comment. “Not a single spot where
a fellow could run a boat ashore. You’d have to
fairly fight your way through the bushes.”</p>

<p>“That’s what makes them so beautiful,” said
Fred. “I never saw prettier islands anywhere—not
even over at Lake George.”</p>

<p>Having gone around all the Cat and Kittens,
they set out for the eastern shore of Big Bear
Lake, heading for the cove into which the recovered
rowboat had drifted.</p>

<p>“We might possibly pick up one or both of the
oars we lost,” said Randy. “I’d like to get them
back.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Randy, you mustn’t worry about those<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212"></a>[212]</span>
oars,” put in Gif. “They were not worth a fortune,
and we’ve got several extra pairs up at
the bungalow, as you know.”</p>

<p>Nevertheless, with plenty of time on hand,
the boys spent the best part of an hour skirting
the cove and looking into every corner where they
thought the oars might have drifted. Once they
thought they saw one of the oars, but the object
proved to be nothing more than a sunken log.</p>

<p>“I suppose we might as well give it up,” said
Randy, after a while. “Let’s go around to the
Willoughby camp and see what those fellows are
doing.”</p>

<p>A row of less than ten minutes brought them
in sight of the camp occupied by the cadets from
Longley Academy. The little dock and the two
small bungalows behind it seemed to be deserted,
not a soul being anywhere in sight.</p>

<p>“Must have all gone off for the day,” said
Jack. “Well, I don’t blame them for wanting
to get away when the weather is so fine. Plenty
of time to stick around camp when it rains.”</p>

<p>“Shall we go ashore?” questioned Fred.</p>

<p>“Better not,” came from Spouter. “If we
landed and anything was found to be wrong afterwards
they’d say we did it.”</p>

<p>“Listen! I hear somebody calling!” cried Andy
suddenly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213"></a>[213]</span></p>

<p>“It’s a cheer! Somebody is cheering!” exclaimed
Jack.</p>

<p>“I believe they’re having some sort of a game,”
said Gif. “They’re out in that cleared spot up
the lake a bit.”</p>

<p>“Come on! Let’s row in that direction!” cried
Randy.</p>

<p>They were soon at a point on the lakeshore
where only a thin fringe of bushes and trees
separated them from what had once been a
pasture lot belonging to a small farm. Here they
discovered half a dozen of the Longley cadets
enjoying a game of baseball with two boys batting
and the others in the field.</p>

<p>“There is Tommy Flanders,” said Fred, in a
low tone as they brought their rowboat to a
standstill. “He’s at the bat!”</p>

<p>“And there is Billy Sands on first, and Halliday
is pitching.”</p>

<p>“Codfish is in the field. There is the fellow
they called Fiddler, too.”</p>

<p>Flanders, who had just had two strikes called
on him, now knocked a ball well out in the field
and began to run to first base, and then back to
home. Codfish tried to catch the ball, but missed
it and went sprawling on the grass.</p>

<p>“Good work, Tommy!” cried one of the boys,
as the runner came in.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214"></a>[214]</span></p>

<p>“Hello! what are you fellows doing here?”
came a sudden cry from the brushwood. “If it
isn’t the fellows from Colby Hall! What do
you know about that?”</p>

<p>The speaker was a Longley boy named Bob
Mason whom Jack and Gif knew fairly well. He
had been tramping along the shore looking for a
good place to fish. He carried a fishing pole in
one hand and a can of bait in the other.</p>

<p>“Oh, we just thought we’d take a little row,”
answered Gif pleasantly. “We get tired of sticking
in one place.”</p>

<p>“I don’t blame you,” answered the Longley
cadet. Then he set up a shout: “Hi, you fellows!
Come over and see who’s here!”</p>

<p>“What’s that?” questioned Billy Sands, as the
baseball game came to an abrupt halt.</p>

<p>“Here are the fellows from Colby Hall!” called
back Mason.</p>

<p>“Colby Hall!” exclaimed Billy Sands. “What
are they doing here?” And then he and the others
forsook the improvised diamond and came crowding
down to the lakeshore.</p>

<p>“Have you fellows been up to our bungalows?”
demanded Tommy Flanders before the visitors
could say a word.</p>

<p>“No. We haven’t been ashore. We’re just
rowing around the lake,” answered Jack.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215"></a>[215]</span></p>

<p>“Huh! Spying around our camp, eh?”</p>

<p>“We have a right to look at it, haven’t we?”
demanded Gif sharply.</p>

<p>“Oh, you don’t have to get on any high horse,
Gif Garrison, just because your father owns that
bungalow on the other side of the lake,” cried
Paul Halliday. “This is our side, and we want
you to keep away from it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, say, Halliday! what’s the use of acting
that way?” put in Bob Mason. “They aren’t
doing any harm. The lake is free to anybody.”</p>

<p>“You can’t tell me anything about that crowd,
Mason. I know them better than you do,”
answered Paul Halliday sullenly. “I didn’t leave
Colby Hall for nothing.”</p>

<p>“We left it as much as anything to get rid of
that bunch,” put in Billy Sands.</p>

<p>“They always want to pick on a fellow,” came
from Codfish. “They’re as mean as dirt. I think
all of the fellows here ought to make them keep
away.”</p>

<p>“We won’t come near your camp if you don’t
want us to,” answered Jack. “You can keep to
your side of the lake and we’ll keep to ours.”</p>

<p>By this time several other of the Longley boys
had appeared, including Ted Maxwell. Most of
the crowd were of the Flanders stripe and apt
to take sides against the Rover boys and their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216"></a>[216]</span>
chums. But Maxwell and Mason, on the other
hand, wanted to be friendly.</p>

<p>“No use of getting hot about it, Tommy,”
said Maxwell to Flanders. “Why not have some
good-natured rivalry? We might have some rowing
races, some swimming races, and we might
even get up a baseball game, six on a side—that
is, if they would care to play with six men.”</p>

<p>“You’ve got the right spirit, Maxwell,”
answered Jack promptly. “We’ll go into any
contest against you that you suggest. We’ll row
you or swim you or play baseball against you.
Or we’ll even shoot against you if you say so,”
he added, with a smile.</p>

<p>“That’s the talk!” cried Mason. “Let’s get
up a few contests. This outing is getting awfully
stale, anyhow.”</p>

<p>“We don’t want any contests with them,”
grumbled Flanders.</p>

<p>“Sounds as if you were afraid,” put in Fred.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m not afraid. But I like to pick my
opponents.”</p>

<p>“Well, we’ll be ready for you any time you
say,” called out Gif, after a few whispered words
with his companions. And thereupon he and his
chums rowed away.</p>

<small>THE BIG BEAR</small></h2>
</div>


<p>“I wonder if we’ll hear from them again,”
remarked Spouter, after the rowboat had gotten
out of the hearing of the Longley cadets.</p>

<p>“We’ll hear from them if Maxwell and Mason
have their say,” answered Jack. “Those two
chaps seem to be pretty decent fellows.”</p>

<p>“Maybe they’ll shame the others into some
sort of a contest,” was Randy’s comment.</p>

<p>“If they don’t offer to do something it will
show they’re afraid,” came from Andy.</p>

<p>“I’d like to play a game of baseball with them,”
said Jack. He had been very sorry not to be
able to get in the games held during the school
term.</p>

<p>“Gee! but wouldn’t we give it to ’em though?”
murmured Fred. “I’d just love to knock Tommy
Flanders out of the box again!”</p>

<p>“They’d want us to get a full nine together,
and I don’t know how we’d manage it,” said Gif.
“With only six fellows, we’d have no outfielders
at all.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218"></a>[218]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, maybe we could pick up three fellows at
Rocky Run or at Beldane,” suggested Spouter.</p>

<p>“Well, we wouldn’t need any outside fellows
if we went into a rowing race or a swimming contest,”
said Fred. “They would be lots of fun,
too.”</p>

<p>“And we might get up some running races,”
suggested Gif. “There is a footpath all the way
around the lake, so we could arrange to run to
Rocky Run and back or to Beldane and back or
any other place. It would be lots of sport—a race
along a footpath through the woods!”</p>

<p>“Fine chance to trip over a tree root and break
your neck,” chuckled Andy. “Just the same, I
wouldn’t mind going into such a race myself,”
he added quickly.</p>

<p>The boys continued to talk the matter over as
they rowed slowly along the lake front in the
direction of Beldane. Then, when it was almost
five o’clock, they turned to cross the lake at a
point considerably below where the Garrison
bungalow was located.</p>

<p>“There’s a wide cove up yonder,” said Gif,
pointing with his hand. “Some day we’ll have
to go and explore it. The old hunters used to
call it Big Bear Cove.”</p>

<p>“That must be, then, where the bears hold
out,” cried Randy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219"></a>[219]</span></p>

<p>“I don’t know much about that, Randy. Nowadays
names don’t seem to count for much. You’ll
go to a place called Rosedale and not find a rose
in it.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I once went to a place called Cherryville,”
said Spouter, “and so far as I could find out there
wasn’t a cherry tree anywhere around.”</p>

<p>“How about Rocky Run?” questioned Jack.
“Did any of you see any unusual amount of rocks
around that place? I didn’t.”</p>

<p>“Well, let’s take a look at Big Bear Cove,
anyway,” suggested Fred. “We’ve got lots of
time. You can bet Jeff won’t be in any great
hurry about dinner to-night.”</p>

<p>“More than likely he’ll just be starting it when
we get back,” said Gif, his face clouding. “That
coon certainly takes the medal for laziness. I
wish dad would get rid of him.”</p>

<p>Still taking their time, the boys followed the
shore of the lake for a quarter of a mile more
and then turned into the opening known as Big
Bear Cove. Here there were a number of small
islands, all as well wooded as the Cat and Kittens.</p>

<p>“Seems to me this ought to be a lumberman’s
paradise,” remarked Andy.</p>

<p>“Not such a paradise as you would think,
Andy,” answered Gif. “You see, the growth is
so thick none of the trees have much of a chance.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220"></a>[220]</span>
Consequently, only a few of them are of a size
to meet a lumberman’s approval. Many of
them, too, are all twisted out of shape. There is
one place back of our bungalow that is so thick
it’s known locally as The Barrier because the
lumbermen and hunters have found it impossible
to get through the thickets.”</p>

<p>“Dandy place to get lost in, I’ll say,” remarked
Randy dryly.</p>

<p>“What a grand—oh, what a sublime spectacle!”
murmured Spouter, who was standing up in the
stern of the rowboat looking around. “What a
picture for a painter! Can’t you see what wonderful
water colors an artist could paint here?
Just think of the inspiration he could get from
yonder pretty inlet with those stately trees and
those beautiful overhanging bushes. And then—Great
Scott, boys, look!”</p>

<p>Spouter’s flowery oration came to a sudden
close, and, giving a gasp, he pointed up the cove
to where a series of rocks jutted out into the
water. On the rocks was a huge form which
suddenly came up on its hind legs the better to
get a view of what was beyond.</p>

<p>“It’s a bear! A big black bear!” ejaculated
Fred.</p>

<p>“A bear! A bear!” was the cry, and all of
the boys fairly glued their eyes on the bear that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221"></a>[221]</span>
still remained reared on its hind legs looking out
toward the lake.</p>

<p>“Oh, what a shot!” murmured Jack. “If only
we had a gun!”</p>

<p>“And we didn’t even bring a pistol!” groaned
Fred.</p>

<p>“Nor a camera,” put in Spouter. “Talk about
a picture! Wouldn’t it be a dandy?”</p>

<p>So far the bear had not seen the rowboat nor
the boys. But now the gaze of the big creature
suddenly shifted just as Randy and Fred dropped
their oars into the water to row closer. There
was a sudden snort of astonishment. The bear
came down on all fours and in a second more
the creature had leaped from the rocks and
plunged out of sight into the brushwood behind.</p>

<p>“He’s gone!”</p>

<p>“Wasn’t he a big one?”</p>

<p>“No wonder they call this Big Bear Lake!”
exclaimed Jack. “He was as big as any bear I
ever saw in the Zoo.”</p>

<p>“And just to think we didn’t have a gun!”
murmured Randy. “Oh, what rotten luck!”</p>

<p>“It’s the old story of seeing the biggest game
when you haven’t got a gun,” remarked Randy.
“What do you think, Gif?” he went on. “Would
it be worth while to row to the bungalow and
get our guns and go after that bear?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222"></a>[222]</span></p>

<p>“I don’t think so,” was the ready reply. “We
scared him so that he’s probably a mile or more
away by this time.”</p>

<p>“Just the same, I think we ought to come up
and hunt for him some time,” said Jack. “We
might be able to trail him through the brushwood.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes! let’s hunt for him, by all means,”
cried Fred.</p>

<p>“What if the bear does a little hunting on his
own account?” questioned Andy.</p>

<p>“You’re not afraid, are you, Andy?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, Fred. But when we go bear hunting
we’ve got to be mighty careful. You know it
isn’t like hunting rabbits or squirrels.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I know that.”</p>

<p>The boys could not resist the temptation to row
to the point of rocks where they had seen the
bear, and they even went ashore to take a look
around. They soon satisfied themselves that
bruin was no longer in that vicinity.</p>

<p>“My! but didn’t he look big when he sat up?”
cried Fred. “I’ll bet he was eight feet high.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I wouldn’t say that, Fred,” answered
Jack. “Just the same, he was pretty big for a
black bear.”</p>

<p>“I’d hate to have him rise up in front of me
and hug me,” said Spouter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223"></a>[223]</span></p>

<p>“I wonder if there are any other bears around
here,” remarked Fred.</p>

<p>“More than likely. It’s very seldom that you’ll
find a bear traveling entirely alone. Most likely
the mate of the bear is somewhere around.”</p>

<p>At last the boys turned away from the rocky
point and rowed out of the cove in the direction
of their bungalow. They had spent more time
than they had expected, and now found the sun
setting over the trees to the westward.</p>

<p>“Gee, this rowing has made me as hungry as
any bear!” announced Randy.</p>

<p>“Same here,” answered Spouter. “I do hope
Jeff has dinner ready.”</p>

<p>“Some fried fish and fried potatoes won’t go
half bad,” put in Jack.</p>

<p>“I told him to have it ready at six o’clock,
and it’s now half past,” came from Gif. “I hope
he hasn’t burnt any of the stuff waiting for us.”</p>

<p>The lads were soon in sight of the bungalow.
As they came closer a smell of cooking mingled
with a smell of something burning greeted their
nostrils.</p>

<p>“He’s got supper ready, all right enough,” announced
Gif.</p>

<p>“But what’s that burning?” cried Jack.</p>

<p>“Must be something on the stove,” returned
Spouter. “Maybe he spilled something.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224"></a>[224]</span></p>

<p>“We’ll soon see,” cried Gif, and as soon as
the boat reached the little dock he leaped ashore,
followed by the others.</p>

<p>As they hurried to the bungalow they found
black smoke pouring from the open doorway.
Rushing inside, they saw that smoke was coming
from the kitchen.</p>

<p>“Hi, Jeff! what’s the matter?” cried Gif.</p>

<p>To this question there was no response, and a
glance around showed that the colored man was
nowhere in sight. On the stove rested a large pan
of fried fish and another pan containing fried
potatoes. Both the fish and the potatoes were
much overdone, and each pan was sending forth
a volume of smoke.</p>

<p>“Confound him!” cried Gif. “He’s let the fish
and the potatoes burn! What do you know about
that?”</p>

<p>“Better get them outside, Gif,” answered Jack,
who was close by his chum. “Here, give me that
pan!” And, catching up a cloth, he caught hold
of the pan of fried potatoes and carried it outside.
Gif followed with the pan of fish. Other
things were on the back of the stove, and these
were likewise beginning to burn.</p>

<p>It must be confessed that Gif was thoroughly
angry, and so were all the other boys. They
had returned to the bungalow, each with a hearty<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225"></a>[225]</span>
appetite, and now the expected dinner was burnt
and worthless.</p>

<p>“I wonder where Jeff went?” questioned Jack,
glancing around.</p>

<p>“He ought to have his neck wrung!” growled
Gif.</p>

<p>“Maybe something happened to him,” returned
Spouter.</p>

<p>Hastily the six cadets started on a search
around the bungalow. It came to an end almost
immediately as Andy set up a low cry.</p>

<p>“Here he is! He’s asleep!”</p>

<p>“Asleep!” snorted Gif. “The idea! I’ve half
a mind to use a horsewhip on him!”</p>

<p>Andy had found Jeff lying in one of the hammocks.
The colored man, bedecked in his big
kitchen apron and wearing his cook’s cap, was
fast asleep and snoring lustily.</p>

<p>“I’ll fix him, the black rascal!” began Gif, and
started to rush forward when Andy suddenly
stopped him.</p>

<p>“Wait a minute, Gif,” said the fun-loving
Rover, in a low voice. “Wait a minute! We’ll
give that coon the surprise of his life.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXII">CHAPTER XXII<br />
<small>THE DEPARTURE OF JEFF</small></h2>
</div>


<p>As has been mentioned before, some of the
hammocks which the boys had slung were close
to the water’s edge. One hammock, put up by
Randy, hung across a small stream that at that
point flowed into Big Bear Lake. It was this
hammock into which Jeff had thrown himself,
probably while waiting for the lads to return.</p>

<p>“What are you going to do, Andy?” questioned
Jack.</p>

<p>“Let him down into the brook. It will do him
good,” returned the fun-loving Rover.</p>

<p>“Now you are talking!” came from Gif.
“Souse him good! He deserves it!”</p>

<p>Everyone of the boys was willing to teach
Jeff a lesson, and the others watched with interest
while Andy brought forth his pocketknife
and commenced to saw away at the rope that
held the hammock in place. All unconscious of
what was going on, Jeff snored away as lustily
as ever.</p>

<p>“It’s going!” whispered Andy, a few seconds<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227"></a>[227]</span>
later. “Watch him, boys, but get out of sight.”</p>

<p>The others understood and quickly sprang behind
the neighboring trees. Then Andy gave a
final slash.</p>

<p>Crack! The rope parted. Splash! <a href="#i_fp226">The hammock
with Jeff in it struck the brook</a>, sending
the water flying in every direction. Then the
colored man rolled over and the next instant was
floundering around vigorously.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="i_fp226">
  <img src="images/i_fp226.jpg" alt="" title="" />
  <div class="caption">
    <p class="noic"><a href="#Page_227">THE HAMMOCK, WITH JEFF IN IT, STRUCK THE BROOK.</a></p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>“Hi! Hi! Save me! I’s drownin’! I’s
drownin’!” he bellowed. “Save me!” And
then he began to flounder around worse than ever.</p>

<p>The boys could not resist the temptation to
laugh, and suddenly they burst out in a roar, in
the midst of which Jeff suddenly stopped his
struggling and arose to his feet in about two feet
of water and mud. He gazed at the broken-down
hammock ruefully, and then his eyes wandered
in the direction of those who were taking
in the scene.</p>

<p>“Wha—wha—what’s dis?” he stammered.
“Who—who— How—how did I come in dat
brook?”</p>

<p>“Jeff, what were you doing in that hammock?”
demanded Gif.</p>

<p>“I—I jest been restin’, Mr. Gif. Jest been
restin’ a minute waitin’ for you young gen’lemen
to get back,” answered the colored man lamely.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228"></a>[228]</span></p>

<p>“Just been resting for a minute!” stormed Gif.
“You were sleeping as soundly as a rock and snoring
to beat the band.”</p>

<p>“And you let the supper burn up!” put in Jack.</p>

<p>“All those fine fish we caught, worthless!”
added Spouter.</p>

<p>“Burnt up! Who says they’re burnt up?”
cried the colored man, walking out of the brook
and stamping the mud from his feet. “I didn’t
burn nothin’.”</p>

<p>“Yes, you did. Everything is burnt,” answered
Gif. “Just go and see for yourself.
What are we going to do for dinner?”</p>

<p>Jeff started toward the back of the bungalow
and then saw the pan of burnt fish and the other
pan of burnt potatoes, both resting on the ground
near the doorway. His face fell, but then, of a
sudden, he turned around savagely.</p>

<p>“I don’t care! I didn’t mean to burn that supper
up! You was so long comin’ I jest thought
I’d rest a minute. You didn’t have no call to flop
me into the water.”</p>

<p>“You’re lazy and good-for-nothing, Jeff,” answered
Gif sternly. “The best thing you can do
is to get out of this camp. I’d rather do the
work myself than have you around.”</p>

<p>“Let him go,” answered Jack. “We can do<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229"></a>[229]</span>
the work between us. We’ve done such work
before.”</p>

<p>“I don’t like it up here nohow,” said the colored
man. “They’s too much to do with so many
young fellows around. I’d rather go back.”</p>

<p>“Then you go,” answered Gif. “But remember,
I’m going to write to my father and let him
know just how lazy and worthless you’ve been
here; and I’ll get the other boys to write too, so
he’ll know the truth of the matter.”</p>

<p>“When do you want me to go back?” questioned
the colored man, after a pause. He was
now just a little bit scared.</p>

<p>“You can go back to-night if you want to, or
otherwise to-morrow. But if you stay here to-night
you clean up this muss and clean those frying
pans. And you get busy and cook us something
worth eating, and be quick about it,” returned
Gif.</p>

<p>To this the colored man did not reply, but,
taking up the frying pans, he disappeared into
the kitchen. Presently the boys heard him clattering
around among the kettles and pans and
knew he was doing what he could to prepare another
meal for them.</p>

<p>It took Jeff the best part of an hour to prepare
another meal, and even then it was not as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230"></a>[230]</span>
good as the boys would have wished. The colored
fellow was very sullen, and they could see
that he was on the point of breaking out. Gif,
however, gave him no chance, and suggested
that he take the morning train at Rocky Run for
home.</p>

<p>“How is I goin’ to get to Rocky Run with my
baggage?” asked Jeff.</p>

<p>“I’ll row you over directly after breakfast,”
answered Gif.</p>

<p>“I’ll go with you, Gif,” said Jack.</p>

<p>During the night Jeff must have thought the
matter over and come to the conclusion that he
was in wrong, for he was up early in the morning
and had an excellent breakfast awaiting the
boys when they arose. He suggested in a roundabout
way to Gif that he remain at the camp as
originally intended.</p>

<p>“No, Jeff, I’ve made up my mind we’re going
to do without you,” said Gif. “You’re too lazy
and shiftless. You get your things together and
Jack and I will row you over to Rocky Run
where you can get the train and go home.”</p>

<p>The boys were ready at the appointed time,
and much against his will Jeff proceeded to get
his baggage into shape and then came down and
got into the rowboat. In silence Gif and Jack<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231"></a>[231]</span>
rowed him to Rocky Run, arriving there some
ten minutes before train time.</p>

<p>“Now there’s your ticket, Jeff,” said Gif, after
he had procured it. “And that’s all.” And
thereupon he and Jack left the colored man at the
railroad station waiting for the train.</p>

<p>“It ain’t right,” said Jeff sullenly. “It ain’t
right nohow. I came up here to have a job for
the rest of the summer. It ain’t right to send me
off. You’ll be sorry for it some day.”</p>

<p>To this neither of the boys made answer.
They wished a few things from Mose Mumbleton’s
store and they also wanted to know if any
mail matter had come in the day before.</p>

<p>There were half a dozen letters, one from
home, two from Valley Brook Farm, and several
from their school chums.</p>

<p>“Hello, here’s news!” cried Gif, as he read
one of the communications. “This is from Dan
Soppinger, and he says he and Fatty Hendry
and Ned Lowe and Walt Baxter are on an auto
tour and expect to pass through Beldane in a
couple of days, and if we’ll come there and
show ’em the way they might visit our bungalow.”</p>

<p>“Good!” returned Jack. “I’d like first rate to
see those lads. It will brighten things up a bit
to have them at the camp.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232"></a>[232]</span></p>

<p>“Say, Jack! if those fellows would only stay
over a few days it would give us a chance to
get up a baseball match against the Longley
bunch.”</p>

<p>“So it would! We’d have our six fellows here
and Dan, Walt and Ned. I don’t suppose Fatty
Hendry would care to play. He never was much
at baseball.”</p>

<p>“He could be one of the umpires. We’d probably
want two—one from each side. That is,
unless we could get some outsider.”</p>

<p>“It would be better to have an outsider, Gif.
They wouldn’t be satisfied with our man’s decisions
and probably we wouldn’t be satisfied
with the decisions from their side.”</p>

<p>“Well, anyway, we’ll have to go down to Beldane
and meet them. Then we can talk the
matter over. Maybe, after all, Longley won’t
give us a match. You know how Tommy Flanders
felt about it.”</p>

<p>“Yes. But I think Ted Maxwell has more
influence with the crowd than Tommy Flanders.”</p>

<p>As before, Jack had a letter from Ruth. The
girls were talking of returning to New York
and then the crowd were to visit May Powell.
Ruth wrote that her father was still somewhat
sick and greatly worried over his business affairs
and over the loss of his book of formulas.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233"></a>[233]</span></p>

<p>“That certainly is a mystery, Jack,” said Gif,
when the young major mentioned the matter to
him. “I don’t see why he doesn’t get some first-class
detectives on the trail of those thieves.”</p>

<p>“I suppose he has somebody on the case,”
answered Jack. “It’s pretty hard, though, to do
anything if you haven’t got some sort of clue
to work on.”</p>

<p>“I think I’d follow up the Germans who sold
the formulas in the first place.”</p>

<p>“As for that, he is convinced that they were
perfectly honest in the matter. I think the thing
to do is to follow up those two other men they
mentioned, Lemrech and Norris.”</p>

<p>Having finished reading their letters and placing
the letters for the other lads in their pockets,
Gif and Jack procured such supplies as the camp
needed, paid for them, and started down toward
their rowboat. As they were stowing their supplies
away they glanced along the lakeshore and
were somewhat surprised to see one of the boats
from the Willoughby camp tied up there. Then
they saw Halliday, Sands and the youth called
Fiddler talking earnestly to Jeff. They had been
told that the morning train was late and would
not arrive for a good half hour.</p>

<p>“I wonder what those fellows want of Jeff.
They don’t know him,” said Jack curiously.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234"></a>[234]</span></p>

<p>The boys from Colby were on the point of rowing
back to the bungalow when suddenly Billy
Sands came running forward, hailing them.</p>

<p>“What do you want, Sands?” questioned Gif,
bringing the rowboat to a stop.</p>

<p>“I want to ask you something about this colored
man,” answered Sands. “He worked for
you, didn’t he?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Is he honest and all that sort of thing?”</p>

<p>“He’s honest so far as we know.”</p>

<p>“Pretty good cook, too, isn’t he?”</p>

<p>“Sometimes. What do you want to know for?”</p>

<p>“Why, we’re thinking of taking him up to
our camp. We’re tired of doing our own work.”</p>

<p>“Well, you’re welcome to Jeff if you want him.
We’re through with him. We prefer to do our
own work.”</p>

<p>“I see.” Sands paused for a moment. “You
say he’s perfectly honest?”</p>

<p>“As far as we know.”</p>

<p>“And he’s a fairly good cook?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Hum!” Sands rubbed his chin reflectively.
“Well, I think maybe we’ll give him a chance.
It’s awfully hard to get anybody up here.” And
thereupon rather abruptly he started to walk back
to his cronies.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXIII">CHAPTER XXIII<br />
<small>DEEP IN THE WOODS</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Of course the other boys were greatly interested
in the news that Gif and Jack had to impart when
they returned to the bungalow. They found the
other lads cleaning up not only the living room
and the bedrooms, but likewise the kitchen.</p>

<p>“Now that Jeff has gone we’re going to have
everything in apple-pie order,” said Fred. “Of
course, we’ll have to take turns at getting the meals
and all that sort of thing.”</p>

<p>“You can’t imagine where Jeff is going,” cried
Jack, and thereupon related what had occurred at
Rocky Run.</p>

<p>“Well, as far as I am concerned those Longley
fellows are welcome to Jeff,” was Randy’s comment.</p>

<p>“I’ll bet they get sick of him pretty quick,”
came from Spouter. “They won’t like his laziness
any more than we did.”</p>

<p>Then Gif and Jack told about the possible visit
from the other Colby Hall cadets and passed over
the letters received.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236"></a>[236]</span></p>

<p>“On a tour!” cried Andy. “What do you know
about that? Some style, I’ll say! I suppose they’ll
want to put up at the best hotel in Beldane.”</p>

<p>“We’ll have to have ’em over here, by all
means,” cried his twin.</p>

<p>“Sure, we’ll have to have them over,” answered
Gif. “The bungalow is plenty big enough. And
besides we were thinking we might get up a baseball
game against the Longley bunch.”</p>

<p>“Right-o!” cried Fred.</p>

<p>“And we’ll wallop them good and plenty,” said
Spouter.</p>

<p>“Why can’t we challenge ’em right away?”
asked Andy impatiently.</p>

<p>“No, we’d better wait until the other fellows
get here. They may not want to stay that long
and they may not want to play in a match.”</p>

<p>“Oh, nonsense! They’ll play quick enough.”
Nevertheless, it was decided that no challenge
should be issued until the other boys were on
hand.</p>

<p>Now that Jeff was gone, the boys felt more at
home than ever. They could do exactly as they
pleased with no older person to interfere.</p>

<p>“Gif, you’ll have to make out a regular schedule
for us to follow,” said Jack. “You’re at the head
of the camp, you know.”</p>

<p>“Fiddlesticks!” cried Gif. “You fellows have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237"></a>[237]</span>
as much to say here as I have. This is an every-man-for-himself
camp.”</p>

<p>Just the same a schedule was made out, the
boys taking turns in pairs at cooking while the
others took turns at making beds and cleaning up
generally. This schedule worked out very well,
and while some of the things may not have been
cooked as well as if the colored man had served
them, nobody complained.</p>

<p>The boys had not forgotten about the big black
bear, and on the following day all set out on a
hunt. Each carried firearms of some sort, and
they likewise took with them a substantial lunch,
for there was no telling when they would get back
to the bungalow.</p>

<p>“Now that Jeff is gone, I guess we’d better lock
up the bungalow,” said Gif. “We don’t want any
tramps or wild animals to get into it.”</p>

<p>“What about the boats?” questioned Spouter.</p>

<p>“Oh, we’ll leave them tied up. I think they’ll
be safe enough. We can put the oars in the
house.” And this was done.</p>

<p>Gif was acquainted with the path that ran along
the lakeshore, and he led the way with the others
following close behind. They passed through
some heavy brushwood, and then made their way
around and over a series of rough rocks.</p>

<p>“Say, this puts me in mind of some of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238"></a>[238]</span>
climbing we did when we located that cave where
those fellows had the German submarine,” remarked
Fred, referring to a time which has been
described in detail in the volume entitled “The
Rover Boys Under Canvas.”</p>

<p>“Gee, but those were exciting times!” said
Jack.</p>

<p>“Oh, we’ve had some other exciting times since
then,” came from Randy. “Don’t forget our days
down in Texas and out at Big Horn Ranch.”</p>

<p>The six lads pressed on, Gif and Jack somewhat
in advance and the others following more slowly.
Spouter brought up the rear, for he was very apt
at times to stop to view the situation.</p>

<p>“I never saw more beautiful views,” said he, as
he came to a halt at a point where the path overlooked
the sparkling lake. “Every turn is beautiful
enough to drive an artist crazy. I wish I could
paint. I’d like to spend the whole summer doing
some of these scenes.”</p>

<p>“We’ve got to pay more attention to taking pictures,
Spouter,” answered Randy. “A nice collection
of photos will give us something to remember
this outing by.”</p>

<p>As they walked through the woods they started
up some small game, but did not attempt to do
any shooting, not being certain in regard to the
game laws. Besides, they knew that a shot would<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239"></a>[239]</span>
frighten the bear if it was anywhere in that
vicinity. They had small cameras along and occasionally
stopped to snap a picture or two.</p>

<p>Presently they reached the rocky point where
the bear had been seen. They approached cautiously,
thinking that bruin might possibly be in
sight. But nothing came to view.</p>

<p>“I bet this is a good cove for fishing,” remarked
Fred. “I’m quite sure I saw some fish stirring
around over there just now.”</p>

<p>“Well, we’re not out for fish now,” answered
Gif. “We want to get on the trail of Mr. Bear
if we can.”</p>

<p>Leaving the point of rocks, the six cadets
plunged into the woods, following a trail which
they knew must have been made by wild animals.
As they advanced they spread out a little to the
right and to the left, always, however, keeping
within sight of each other.</p>

<p>“We’ve got to do that,” cautioned Jack. “Otherwise
some of us may get lost, and it would be a
serious business to get lost in such a thick woods
as this is.”</p>

<p>“It certainly is an ideal spot for wild animals,”
said Spouter. “I wonder if there are any deer
here?”</p>

<p>“Sure!” answered Gif. “But whether we’ll see
any or not is another story.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240"></a>[240]</span></p>

<p>“It wouldn’t do us any good if we did see some
deer,” said Randy. “It’s out of season to shoot
them.”</p>

<p>“That’s true.”</p>

<p>On and on went the six boys, deeper and deeper
into the forest. The trail which was fairly well
defined led up a small hill, and here they came to
an opening from which they could see for several
miles around.</p>

<p>“Here is a pretty good view of the lake,” observed
Spouter. “And see! There are some rowboats!”</p>

<p>“Wonder if they are the rowboats belonging to
the Longley boys,” remarked Jack.</p>

<p>“There is a motor-boat off to the north,” said
Randy. “I suppose that’s one of the boats belonging
to Beldane. I understand they have several
of them up at the hotel.”</p>

<p>Having rested for a short while on the hill,
they took up the trail once more and plunged down
into the forest on the other side. Here, after
only a few rods had been covered, they found the
trail spreading into three forks.</p>

<p>“Now, then, which fork shall we follow?” questioned
Jack.</p>

<p>“Don’t ask me,” answered Gif. “You know as
much about it as I do.”</p>

<p>The six lads examined the three forks as best<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241"></a>[241]</span>
they could, and after a brief discussion decided to
follow that leading southward.</p>

<p>“There is no use of getting too far from home,”
said Gif. “As it is, we’ll be pretty tired by the
time we get back.”</p>

<p>By noon the six boys were tired and hungry
and perfectly willing to rest for the midday lunch.
They had brought sandwiches, crackers and cake
with them, and washed this food down with some
water from a nearby spring. They took their time
over the meal, and then rested for another half
hour before resuming their hunt.</p>

<p>“Looks as if we were going to be skunked,”
remarked Randy presently, after they had climbed
up the side of a rough hill and then down again.</p>

<p>“Don’t say anything about skunks,” retorted
Gif. “That’s one animal we don’t care to hit.”</p>

<p>“Oh, a skunk skin is quite valuable in these
days,” said Spouter. “Just the same, I think we’ll
leave those animals alone.”</p>

<p>Several times they stirred up some rabbits and
squirrels, and often came across some birds. Once
they heard a covey of partridges whirring upward,
but they were almost out of sight behind the trees.</p>

<p>“There must be some pretty good hunting here
in the late fall,” remarked Fred. He was sorry
that they could not bring down some of the small
game.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242"></a>[242]</span></p>

<p>“Yes, it would be great to come up here when
the season is open,” answered Gif.</p>

<p>All this time the boys were keeping their eyes
wide open for the possible appearance of a bear.
But either there were no bears in that vicinity or
the animals knew enough to keep out of sight.</p>

<p>“Gee! I’m getting dog tired,” remarked Andy,
about the middle of the afternoon. “If you’ll ask
me, I’ll say let’s head back for the bungalow.”</p>

<p>“I second the motion,” said his twin promptly.</p>

<p>All were tired, even though they did not care
to admit it, and, coming to a small watercourse,
they decided to follow this until they could once
more reach the lakeshore.</p>

<p>“I think it will bring us close to the bungalow,”
said Gif. “In fact, I’m of the opinion it’s the
brook that flows into the lake right beside the
house.”</p>

<p>“You mean the brook that Jeff got his bath
in?” asked Andy.</p>

<p>“That’s it. Of course I may be mistaken, but
I think it’s the same brook.”</p>

<p>It was no easy matter to follow the watercourse,
because the bushes were rather thick on
either side and they did not wish to get their feet
wet if it could be avoided. However, they kept
on steadily, and soon came to an open spot where
going was a bit easier.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243"></a>[243]</span></p>

<p>“What’s the matter with one of us shinning
up a tree to see just where the lake is located?”
remarked Jack presently.</p>

<p>“That’s the idea!” called out Fred. “Andy,
you’re the best monkey of the bunch. Let me
give you a boost up this tree.”</p>

<p>Andy was willing to go up the tree mentioned,
and in a moment several of the others had given
him a lift to the lower branches, and up he went
hand over hand until he was almost at the top of
the tree.</p>

<p>“We’re heading in the right direction,” he called
down. “The lake isn’t more than half a mile
off.”</p>

<p>“Can you see the bungalow?” questioned Gif.</p>

<p>“I can see something in the trees, but whether
it’s the bungalow or not I’m not sure.”</p>

<p>“Look! Look!” burst suddenly from Spouter.
“Andy, take care of yourself!” he shouted.</p>

<p>“What’s the trouble?” came from the top of
the tree.</p>

<p>“Some animal is there, on one of the branches
just below you! I don’t know what it is,” was
Spouter’s quick reply.</p>

<small>SIX BOYS AND A WILDCAT</small></h2>
</div>


<p>All of the other boys were much surprised
by Spouter’s declaration that there was some sort
of animal in the branches of the tree Andy had
just ascended.</p>

<p>“What is it, Spouter?”</p>

<p>“Are you sure you saw it?”</p>

<p>“Was it a squirrel?”</p>

<p>“Couldn’t be a bear, could it?”</p>

<p>“No, it wasn’t a bear. It wasn’t large enough
for a bear,” answered Spouter. “It was just about
the size of a great big tomcat.”</p>

<p>“Maybe it was a wildcat!” exclaimed Gif.
“Wildcats have been shot more than once around
here.”</p>

<p>All of the boys rushed to pick up the firearms
which had been dropped when they had boosted
Andy up the tree. Then they began to circle the
tree, looking up in all directions for a sight of
the wild beast.</p>

<p>“What is it?” yelled Andy. And then he added
quickly: “If you shoot, don’t shoot me!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_245"></a>[245]</span></p>

<p>“We can’t see anything,” answered Jack.</p>

<p>The boys on the ground were alarmed, but
this was as nothing compared to the alarm felt
by Andy. His weapon had been left behind, and
so he was practically defenseless.</p>

<p>“There he is! I see him!” came suddenly from
Randy. “There!” And he pointed to a branch
on one side of the tree. There was a flash of
a hairy body, a quivering of some of the leaves,
and then all became quiet again.</p>

<p>“It was a wildcat!”</p>

<p>“That’s just what it was!”</p>

<p>“Where did he go to?”</p>

<p>“Hi, you fellows!” cried Andy. “If it’s a wildcat
don’t drive it up here!”</p>

<p>“Can’t you break off a tree limb and use it
for a club, Andy?” called out Jack. “Maybe you
can keep the wildcat from reaching you, anyway.”</p>

<p>The words had scarcely been uttered when with
a catlike scream the wildcat suddenly sprang from
one side of the tree to the other. As it passed
through midair all of those below saw it plainly.
It was full grown and had a pair of glaring
greenish eyes and claws that looked exceedingly
formidable.</p>

<p>Bang! It was Spouter’s weapon that spoke,
but the charge of shot passed below the limb on
which the wildcat now rested. The youth had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_246"></a>[246]</span>
been afraid to aim his weapon too high for fear
of hitting Andy.</p>

<p>As the shotgun blazed forth the wildcat leaped
to another branch of the tree. This brought the
beast in full view of where Gif and Jack were
standing. Simultaneously both boys raised their
weapons and blazed away.</p>

<p>“He’s struck! He’s struck!” cried Randy, and
as he uttered the words the wildcat came tumbling
down out of the tree into some brushwood. Here
the beast thrashed around for an instant and then
crouched low as if for a leap at the boys.</p>

<p>“Look out!” yelled Jack. “He’s going to
spring!”</p>

<p>Then with a spitting snarl the wildcat made a
leap. But as it did so the small rifle Fred carried
spoke up and a bullet went straight through its
head, killing it almost instantly.</p>

<p>“Is he dead?” questioned Randy, after the
wildcat had fallen quiveringly on the dead leaves
of the forest.</p>

<p>“I guess so,” answered Fred. “But don’t go
too near, he may be only wounded.”</p>

<p>All of the boys had been taught to load up immediately
after firing, and now their first attention
was given to their weapons.</p>

<p>“How about it? Did you hit him?” questioned Andy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_247"></a>[247]</span></p>

<p>“Yes. He’s as dead as a doornail,” announced
Gif, after a gingerly examination.</p>

<p>“Any more wildcats in the trees?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. But you keep your eyes open.”</p>

<p>In a few minutes Andy was on the ground beside
the others, and all surveyed the wildcat with
interest. It was a full grown creature and had it
had the chance might have done great damage.</p>

<p>“What shall we do with it?” questioned Fred.
“I don’t know that I care for it particularly.”</p>

<p>“We might take it to the bungalow, anyway,”
answered Gif. “If we could take it down to
Beldane we could get a bounty on it.”</p>

<p>“A bounty?” queried Andy.</p>

<p>“Sure! They pay five or ten dollars a head
for wildcats in this state. And they pay a bounty
on bears, too,” he added.</p>

<p>“Would we have to take the whole animal to
Beldane?” questioned Spouter.</p>

<p>“I don’t think so. I think the head and skin
would be plenty. In some places all they ask for
is the ears or the tail, or something like that.”</p>

<p>The boys had learned how to take care of the
game brought down, and now, after taking several
pictures of the animal, they speedily skinned
the wildcat, bringing the head with the pelt. The
carcass they threw into the bushes.</p>

<p>“Well, we got something, anyhow,” said Fred<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_248"></a>[248]</span>
with satisfaction, as they continued to follow the
watercourse toward the lake.</p>

<p>“One fine shot you made, Fred,” answered
Randy.</p>

<p>“Fred, I don’t know what I should have done
if you hadn’t brought him down,” put in Andy.
“He might have come to the top of the tree after
me.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I guess he was more scared than we were,”
answered the stout Rover boy modestly. Yet,
behind it all, he felt quite proud of the shot he
had made. It had been at close range and he had
had to think and act quickly.</p>

<p>The relaxation from the intensity of the situation
was felt by all of the lads, and long before
the bungalow was reached they were in a merry
humor, singing, joking and whistling loudly.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you what we might have done,” said
Gif. “We might have set a bear trap and used
that wildcat for a bait.”</p>

<p>“Would the bear go into such a trap?” questioned
Jack. “I thought they didn’t care very
much for meat, especially in the summer time.
I thought they liked roots and things like that
better.”</p>

<p>“We might have put some maple sugar in the
trap with the meat,” answered Gif. “Bears like
sweets, you know.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_249"></a>[249]</span></p>

<p>The boys arrived at the bungalow about sundown.
All were too tired for a while to do more
than sit around and rest. Finally, however, they
prepared themselves a simple evening meal, and
almost as soon as this was disposed of one after
another shoved off to bed.</p>

<p>“This is the ideal life,” said Jack, as he was
undressing. “A fellow doesn’t have to have any
appetizing sauce for what he eats and he doesn’t
have to be rocked to sleep.”</p>

<p>“My dad always said that it made a new man
of him to spend a week or two up here in the
woods,” answered Gif.</p>

<p>In the morning the boys took their usual plunge
in the lake and after breakfast decided to take
one of the rowboats and go up to Big Bear Cove
and try their hand at fishing. Fred had noted a
certain hole under some large overhanging trees
where he was certain they would be able to get
some pickerel of good size.</p>

<p>As they had done the day before, they took a
lunch with them so that there would be no hurry
about getting back. And this was just as well,
because once they were at the fishing they found
the sport so fine that they hated to think of giving
it up. Each one of them caught both perch and
pickerel, and one of the finny tribe landed by
Jack weighed at least two pounds and a half,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250"></a>[250]</span>
while another, caught by Spouter, weighed almost
as much.</p>

<p>“We’ll have fish enough for several days,” said
Gif.</p>

<p>“If only we can keep some of them alive,”
answered Randy.</p>

<p>“Oh, I think we can. I’ve been fixing up that
pound in the brook, you know.”</p>

<p>The day was not without its surprises. Once
Randy was standing on a small point of rocks and
had what he thought was a magnificent catch.
Suddenly the fish whisked around and before the
lad could save himself he lost his balance and
went into the lake with a big splash.</p>

<p>“Hurrah! Randy’s gone in swimming with all
his clothes on!” cried Andy.</p>

<p>“Don’t let the fish pull you away,” called out
Fred gayly.</p>

<p>“Catch the pole! Catch the pole!” called Randy,
as he came up to his feet and scrambled out on
the rocks. “There goes the fish with my pole!”</p>

<p>Jack handed his own pole to Spouter and made
a leap for the rowboat. Getting in, he sculled
rapidly after the pole, which was being jerked
along the surface of the lake. As he caught the
pole there was a snap, and the empty line came
flying toward him. What became of the fish
they never learned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_251"></a>[251]</span></p>

<p>After that things went along quietly for half
an hour. Then, of a sudden, Spouter let out a
yell.</p>

<p>“Hannibal’s ghost!” he called out. “I’ve got
the biggest fish yet! Gee, I can hardly budge
him!”</p>

<p>“Play him, Spouter! Play him!” called out
Gif. “Don’t let him get away from you.”</p>

<p>“I knew some whopping big fish were down in
that hole,” cried Fred. “Play him for all you’re
worth, Spouter!”</p>

<p>“I can’t budge him,” gasped Spouter. “Gee,
what a catch!”</p>

<p>Spouter was so excited that all the others pulled
in their lines and ran to where he stood close to
the bent-over trees which lined the edge of that
side of the cove. Spouter was trying his best
to haul in, but without avail.</p>

<p>“Maybe your line is caught,” suggested Gif.</p>

<p>“No, it’s a fish. I’m sure of it,” answered
Spouter. “I felt it pull.”</p>

<p>All crowded closer to give Spouter whatever
advice and assistance they could. Even Gif tried
to pull in on the line, but without avail. Finally,
however, Spouter twisted the line a little to one
side, and then up came the hook and attached to it
what looked like the remains of an old hunting
boot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252"></a>[252]</span></p>

<p>“Well, what do you know about that!” cried
Spouter, in disgust. “Nothing but an old boot!”</p>

<p>“And I’ll bet it was caught in between the
loose roots of the trees,” said Jack. And then
there was a general laugh, in which even Spouter
joined.</p>

<p>It was nearly five o’clock before the boys got
into the rowboat again and started to return to
the bungalow. They had fifteen perch and seven
pickerel to their credit, and of this catch they
were justly proud.</p>

<p>“We’ll have one dandy fish supper to-night,”
said Randy, smacking his lips. “And we won’t
have Jeff here to burn it up for us, either.”</p>

<p>“Yum, yum! I can smell the frying fish already,”
murmured Gif.</p>

<p>The boys took turns at rowing and soon reached
the lake proper and then sent the craft flying in
the direction of the bungalow. As they came close
to the dock Spouter, who was looking ahead, set
up a sudden shout of wonder.</p>

<p>“Hello! what do you know about this? The
other boats are gone!”</p>

<p>“The boats gone!” cried Gif. “Are you sure?”</p>

<p>“Look for yourself, Gif. We left them tied to
the dock, didn’t we?”</p>

<p>“We sure did.”</p>

<p>The two boats that had been left at the bungalow<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_253"></a>[253]</span>
dock were certainly missing, and much mystified
the six boys landed, to gaze around in bewilderment.
But gaze as hard as they might, they
could see nothing of the missing craft.</p>

<p>“Do you suppose Tommy Flanders and his
crowd took them away?” questioned Jack.</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t put it past them,” answered Gif.</p>

<p>Fred and Randy had turned toward the front
door of the bungalow. The key to this was hanging
on a nail, and taking it down they unlocked
the door and threw it open. As they passed into
the house a cry of astonishment broke from them.</p>

<p>“Did you ever see anything like it before?”</p>

<p>“Who did this?”</p>

<p>“What’s the matter in there?” called out Gif.</p>

<p>“Matter? Everything’s the matter,” answered
Fred.</p>

<p>“They’ve smashed up the whole house!” added
Randy.</p>

<small>WHAT THE RIVALS DID</small></h2>
</div>


<p>The other lads lost no time in following Fred
and Randy into the bungalow. They too gazed
around in astonishment which readily turned to
dismay and anger.</p>

<p>And <a href="#i_fp258">the lads had good cause to be angry</a>. Someone
had crawled through a window and “rough-housed”
the bungalow thoroughly. Hardly a
thing had been left untouched. All the bedding
was scattered around on the floor, some in the
living room and some in the kitchen, and on top
of this had been piled the furniture and all the
cooking utensils. To add to the mess, books and
papers were scattered in every direction, along
with all their canned goods and such fruit and
vegetables as they happened to have on hand.
A side of bacon rested on one of the bunks and
a ham was in the woodbox under some kindlings.
At one end of the center table, which had been
shoved into a corner, rested in a heap their supply
of coffee and at the other end in another heap
their supply of sugar. All of their plates, cups<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_255"></a>[255]</span>
and saucers were missing, as were also the knives,
forks and spoons. All their extra underwear had
been tied together and in knots.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p>“The Longley bunch did this—that’s as sure
as sure!” cried Jack, as he surveyed the scene.</p>

<p>“I think so myself,” returned Gif. “Some
muss, and no mistake.”</p>

<p>“They ought to be hammered good if they really
did it,” cried Spouter.</p>

<p>“I’d like to take a horsewhip over them,” came
from Fred. “Look at that sugar, will you? And
look at the coffee!”</p>

<p>“Well, anyhow, they didn’t dare scatter it on
the floor,” put in Randy.</p>

<p>“That proves one thing to me,” came quickly
from Jack. “Tommy Flanders and his bunch
didn’t do this alone. If it was the Flanders crowd
alone they wouldn’t hesitate to make all our grub
worthless to us. They would have scattered everything
on the floor or thrown it into the brook,
or something like that.”</p>

<p>“I believe you there, Jack,” answered Randy
quickly. “Some of the better class of fellows must
have been in this. They did it just to be funny.”</p>

<p>It was all the boys could do to make their way
from one room to another of the bungalow since
each of the doorways had been cluttered up by
chairs and benches.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_256"></a>[256]</span></p>

<p>“Nothing to do but to straighten things out,”
remarked Gif. “Some job, I’ll say.”</p>

<p>“Do you suppose they took the boats away?”
questioned Spouter.</p>

<p>“I hardly think so, Spouter,” answered Jack.
“The fellows who did this acted half decently
about it; otherwise a lot of the stuff would have
been actually ruined. And that being so, I don’t
believe they really took the boats away. Probably
they’re only hidden.”</p>

<p>“We ought to look around for the boats before
it gets too dark,” suggested Gif. “We can fix
up things indoors any time.”</p>

<p>“Suppose we divide the work,” suggested Jack.
“I and some of the others can fix up the house
while you and the rest look for the boats.”</p>

<p>This plan was carried out, and Jack and the
twins remained indoors to do what they could
toward straightening out the bungalow while the
others went outside to hunt for the missing rowboats.</p>

<p>To rearrange the interior of the bungalow was
no mean matter, for a large part of the furniture
was heavy and they had to be careful first of all
that they did not damage some of the canned
goods which were scattered in all directions.</p>

<p>“We’ll pick up the apples and potatoes and
onions first,” ordered Jack. “And then we can<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_257"></a>[257]</span>
go at the canned stuff and the meat and things
like that.”</p>

<p>“We’ll have to find the lamps first,” said Andy.
“It’s getting dark.”</p>

<p>The hunt for the three lamps took some time.
They were finally located, minus the chimneys,
in the oven of the stove. The chimneys they discovered
on the back of a pantry shelf.</p>

<p>“Fine thing to put those lamps in the oven!”
snorted Randy. “Suppose we had built a fire
there! That kerosene might have exploded.”</p>

<p>“Yes. And anyway we’ll have to clean that
oven out. Otherwise it may have a kerosene smell
to it when we try to bake something,” added his
brother.</p>

<p>Lighting the lamps and placing them where they
might not be knocked over, the three boys set to
work with a will and inside of half an hour had
salvaged all of the eatables. Then they commenced
to place the furniture in shape and picked
up the bedding and their clothing.</p>

<p>“We’ll have to air the blankets out and dust
them off,” said Jack. “They got rather dirty on
the floor, I’m afraid. And the underwear will
have to be washed—that is after we untie the
knots.”</p>

<p>“It’s queer what became of all the tableware
and knives and that truck,” remarked Andy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_258"></a>[258]</span></p>

<p>“Did you look in the woodbox?” questioned
Jack.</p>

<p>“I did,” came from Randy. “That’s where I
found the ham.”</p>

<p>The boys took the bedding out on the bungalow
porch and shook it vigorously. Then they left it
on chairs to air while they made another search
around the building for the missing table stuff.</p>

<p>They were still on the hunt when they heard a
shout from outside. Running to the rear of the
bungalow they heard voices up the little brook that
at this point flowed into Big Bear Lake, the same
watercourse they had followed when they had encountered
the wildcat.</p>

<p>“Hello!” shouted Jack. “Have you found the
boats?”</p>

<p>“Yes!” came from Gif.</p>

<p>“They’re tied up in the trees!” explained
Spouter.</p>

<p>Jack and the twins ran in the direction of the
voices and presently came upon the other lads
standing at the foot of a tall tree. Swinging from
one of the branches of this tree were the two
missing rowboats.</p>

<p>“Some job they must have had, to tie them up
there,” remarked Andy.</p>

<p>“Yes. And we’re going to have a job to get<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_259"></a>[259]</span>
’em down,” answered Gif. “I think we’d better
let it go over until to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“I’m willing,” said Jack.</p>

<p>“Now you’ve found the boats perhaps you can
find the dishes and knives and forks and spoons,”
said Andy. “We can’t get a trace of ’em.”</p>

<p>All of the lads returned to the bungalow feeling
that the boats would be safe where they were
for the night. They straightened out the rest of
the furniture and made up the beds and then
started to get supper ready.</p>

<p>“I don’t know what we’re going to eat off of,”
remarked Gif. “We’ll have to use tin pans and
basins and kettle tops and whatever is handy.”</p>

<p>“And we’ll have to eat with our pocketknives
and the kitchen fork,” added Randy, with a grin.</p>

<p>“Well, anyway, I’m glad the grub isn’t missing,”
broke in Spouter. “I’m hungry enough to
eat a meal with my fingers.”</p>

<p>They soon had some potatoes on to boil. Then
they cleaned some of the fish and started to fry
them and also made themselves a large pot of
coffee. To the hungry lads the aroma from the
coffee and the smell of frying fish were exceedingly
appetizing.</p>

<p>“Makes a fellow feel like home—a smell like
that,” was Fred’s comment. He was slicing some<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_260"></a>[260]</span>
bread which had been brought from Rocky Run
on the last visit to the store.</p>

<p>It was a comical sight to see the boys try to
eat their supper without any of the tableware.
One used a pie plate, another a saucepan and still
another an old frying pan. Andy used an overturned
teakettle cover and his twin had to get
along with the glazed bottom of a jardiniere
which someone had once left at the bungalow.
All used their pocketknives but Gif and Spouter,
who managed to get possession of the bread knife
and the smaller article used for peeling potatoes.</p>

<p>“This must be like life in the trenches,” remarked
Randy, while they were eating.</p>

<p>“I guess we’re better off than that,” responded
Jack quickly. “Lots of times those poor fellows
had to eat out of their bare hands.”</p>

<p>In spite of the trick that had been played upon
them all of the boys slept soundly that night.
They felt that they would be perfectly safe in retiring
without leaving a guard.</p>

<p>“Those fellows won’t dare show themselves
around here for a while,” remarked Gif. “They’d
be too afraid we’d pitch into ’em.”</p>

<p>“They wouldn’t hang around very long, anyway,
if they saw us with our guns,” added Fred.</p>

<p>“We’ll have to pay ’em back for this little
joke, Fred,” said Andy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_261"></a>[261]</span></p>

<p>“Of course. Just give me the chance and I’ll
show ’em what we’ll do!”</p>

<p>“I think the best we can do is to say nothing
at all about it,” said Jack. “Don’t let on that
anything unusual has happened. That will keep
them guessing.”</p>

<p>In the morning the lads took their usual plunge
in the lake and then Spouter and Fred prepared
breakfast, it being their turn for so doing. While
they were at this the others went outside, first to
indulge in a little horseplay in the way of boxing
and wrestling, and then to throw themselves into
the hammocks which were handy.</p>

<p>Jack was resting in one of the hammocks and
gazing upward when suddenly his eyes rested
upon a couple of potato sacks swinging from
ropes tied to the tree limbs above him. At once
he set up a shout.</p>

<p>“Hi, boys! Here is some more of the stuff, I
guess!”</p>

<p>“Maybe the dishes are in those sacks!” exclaimed
Gif, as he came to view the suspended
bags.</p>

<p>“We’ll soon find out,” was the reply, and Jack
began to climb the tree while the other boys
gathered underneath. Soon he was at the sacks
and felt of them carefully.</p>

<p>“The tableware, all right enough,” he announced.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_262"></a>[262]</span>
“I guess the knives and forks and
spoons are here too,” he added, after feeling
around some more.</p>

<p>A long boat-line was procured and with this
the sacks were lowered carefully to the ground.
As Jack had surmised, they contained all the
crockeryware, as well as the knives, forks and
spoons. Not a single thing seemed to be missing.</p>

<p>“Quite a stunt, I must admit,” said Spouter,
“to hang those things and the boats up in the
trees. We might have hunted around a long
while if Jack hadn’t spotted those sacks.”</p>

<p>Directly after breakfast the boys made their
way to where the boats had been suspended, and
inside of an hour had the craft safe once more
at the lake front.</p>

<p>“Now I guess we’re all fixed,” announced Gif.
“I’m glad it was no worse,” he added, with a sigh
of relief.</p>

<p>“They certainly gave us enough work to do,”
grumbled Fred.</p>

<p>“But not as much as it might have been,”
answered Jack. “If Flanders, Sands and Halliday
were in this they must certainly have been
held back by some of the other Longley boys.
Otherwise they would have smashed up stuff and
scattered it in all directions.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_263"></a>[263]</span></p>

<p>“Maybe Jeff came over with ’em!” cried Andy
suddenly.</p>

<p>“Possibly. But I think this is only the boys’
trick.”</p>

<p>The six lads were taking it easy that day after
supper when they discerned a motor-boat coming
up the lake in their direction. As the craft came
closer several persons in the boat stood up and
waved their hands frantically.</p>

<p>“Hello! who can that be?” cried Jack, leaping
to his feet. And then he ran down to the dock,
followed by the others.</p>

<p>As the motor-boat came closer there was a cry
from across the water.</p>

<p>“Colby Hall, ahoy!”</p>

<p>“Why, it’s Dan and his crowd!” ejaculated
Fred. “What do you know about that!”</p>

<small>THE BASEBALL GAME</small></h2>
</div>


<p>The coming of Dan Soppinger and his crowd
filled the Rover boys and their chums with
pleasure, and they did all they could to make
the new arrivals feel at home.</p>

<p>“We got to Beldane quicker than we thought,”
explained Dan. “And there was a boatman at
the hotel who said he knew where your bungalow
was, so we thought we’d come right up instead
of staying in the town over night.”</p>

<p>“And you did just right!” answered Gif. “And
we want you to stay here for a few days at least.”</p>

<p>“And we want you to help out in a baseball
game. That is, if we can have our challenge
accepted,” put in Jack. And thereupon the other
boys were told about the rival camp on the other
shore of Big Bear Lake.</p>

<p>“Gee, that will suit me!” cried Walt Baxter.</p>

<p>“I’d like to stay here. But don’t ask me to play
ball,” puffed Fatty Hendry. “You know that
exercise is too violent for me. I’m willing to
root, but that’s all.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_265"></a>[265]</span></p>

<p>“I’ll be glad to play,” came from Ned Lowe.
“It’ll be a change from touring. I get rather
cramped sitting in the car all day. Since we
started we’ve done nothing but ride, making a
hundred and fifty miles or more a day.”</p>

<p>“Maybe we can get the motor-boat fellow to
take a challenge across the lake before he goes
back to Baldane,” suggested Gif. The man was
still at the dock awaiting orders from the lads he
had had for passengers.</p>

<p>“That’s the talk! We’ll send the challenge
right away!”</p>

<p>The boatman was consulted and readily consented
to leave the challenge at the Willoughby
camp before returning to the Beldane hotel.</p>

<p>“We want you to put our baggage on check in
the cloakroom until we get back,” said Dan. “And
take good care of our auto, too. You can come
back for us next Monday,” he added, after consulting
Gif. And so it was all arranged.</p>

<p>In the letter to the Longley boys Gif explained
about the arrival of the other lads and challenged
their rivals to a game of baseball on their own
grounds on the coming Saturday afternoon. If
the challenge was accepted the cadets from both
schools were to go to Beldane and there select
an umpire.</p>

<p>The arrival of the challenge from the Colby<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_266"></a>[266]</span>
boys created a great stir in the Longley camp.
Ted Maxwell and a number of others were in
favor of an immediate acceptance, but Flanders
and his cronies demurred.</p>

<p>“I didn’t come here to play ball. I came to
take it easy,” growled Flanders.</p>

<p>“I don’t want anything more to do with them,”
put in Halliday.</p>

<p>“You were willing enough to go over there and
rough-house the place,” came from Maxwell.
“Why not be a real sport? If we don’t play them,
when we get back to school they’ll tell everybody
we were afraid.”</p>

<p>A hot discussion lasting fully an hour followed.
Then a vote was taken and eight of the Longley
boys were found to be in favor of the game while
only three were openly opposed. Thereupon
Flanders and his cronies finally said they would
play.</p>

<p>“And remember,” said Ted Maxwell, “if you
do play you’ve got to do your best.”</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t worry! We’ll wipe ’em off the face
of the earth,” growled Halliday.</p>

<p>“You let me pitch and I won’t let ’em get in a
single run,” added Flanders.</p>

<p>“I’ve got an idea,” went on Maxwell. “We
might make this game quite an affair. They’ve
got a regular ball grounds down at Beldane, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_267"></a>[267]</span>
this week they’re holding a drive for a hospital
that’s to be located there. Why can’t we arrange
to play at Beldane for the benefit of the hospital?
That ought to give us a good audience.”</p>

<p>“You’ll have to talk to Gif Garrison’s crowd
first,” said Bob Mason.</p>

<p>Then came the question of getting an answer
back to Gif. On account of what they had done
at the bungalow scarcely any of the lads wished
to go over to the other shore. They were much
surprised, however, when they landed to find that
not a word was mentioned regarding the “rough-housing”
that had taken place.</p>

<p>“It would be a splendid scheme to play at Beldane
for the benefit of the hospital!” cried Jack.
“That suits me exactly.”</p>

<p>“Let’s do it, by all means,” put in Fred.</p>

<p>And thereupon three boys from each camp set
out in a rowboat for the lower end of the lake
to make the necessary arrangements.</p>

<p>As luck would have it, the ball grounds were
not to be used on the following Saturday, and
the local authorities were only too glad to have
the exhibition game take place for the hospital’s
benefit. No admission fee was to be charged, but
it was understood that during the game a silver
collection would be taken for the benefit of the
proposed institution. “And a silver collection<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_268"></a>[268]</span>
doesn’t mean that you can’t drop a bill in the
basket,” added one of the committee.</p>

<p>Some of the boys had their baseball uniforms
with them, while others managed to either borrow
or rent uniforms, so that on the day set apart for
the game both sides made quite a creditable appearance.
They had new balls and bats, and the
Rover boys and their chums had spent all their
spare time in practice.</p>

<p>As in years gone by, Jack was to pitch for the
Colby Hall team, as it was called, while Tommy
Flanders was to fill the box for Longley Academy.
Fred was to be first baseman, with Randy at third
and Andy in center field. Gif went to second and
also captained the nine.</p>

<p>“You’ll have to act as a substitute, Fatty,
whether you want to or not,” said Gif.</p>

<p>“All right,” answered the stout cadet. “But
please don’t call on me. Finish the game among
yourselves. I’ll be a high and mighty rooter,”
and he grinned.</p>

<p>It was advertised around the lake that two well-known
military academies would play a game of
ball for the benefit of the new hospital and this
brought to the grounds a large number of people,
including quite a few automobile tourists. When
the boys trotted out on the field they were greeted
with applause.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_269"></a>[269]</span></p>

<p>“There are the Colby Hall boys.”</p>

<p>“And there are the cadets from Longley
Academy.”</p>

<p>“Looks as if we might see a pretty good game.”</p>

<p>The manager of the local ball team had consented
to act as umpire, and promptly on time
the game started. Longley was first at the bat
and in a second more Jack found himself facing
Mason.</p>

<p>“Now then, Bob, knock it over the fence!”
cried one of the Longley boys.</p>

<p>“That’s it, Bob! Bring in a homer first clap!”</p>

<p>Although he had not been on the Colby nine
since the new rule concerning officers had gone
into effect, Jack had not given up his baseball
practice and he felt himself in excellent condition
when he caught the ball that the umpire tossed to
him. Then came the command, “Play ball!” and
he gave a warm up-swing and threw the ball over
the plate. Mason was on the alert and promptly
knocked the sphere down to center field where it
was stopped by Andy and quickly sent to first.</p>

<p>“He’s out!”</p>

<p>“Hurrah! First blood for Colby Hall!”</p>

<p>It was a splendid beginning, but such a fine
showing could not last. Before the inning came
to an end the Longley boys had scored two runs,
much to their delight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_270"></a>[270]</span></p>

<p>“Now, Colby, show ’em what you can do!”</p>

<p>Although the left-handed pitcher who had battled
against Colby Hall during the games at
the schools was at the camp, Tommy Flanders had
insisted upon filling the box and now he came
forward with his usual confident air.</p>

<p>“Go at ’em, Tommy! Eat ’em up!” cried Codfish,
who had been playing center field.</p>

<p>Flanders was on his mettle and it must be
confessed that he did very well—so well, indeed,
that the Colby boys were retired in that first
inning without getting further than first base.</p>

<p>“Hurrah! That’s the way we’ll do ’em up!”
shouted one of the Longley supporters.</p>

<p>After this the game went along without either
side scoring until the fifth inning. Then Andy
managed to get a single, followed by a double
from Gif, and then came another single by
Walt, and when the inning came to an end
the score was a tie, 2 to 2.</p>

<p>“Some game, I’ll say,” said one of the men
from the hotel. “Almost as good as the professionals
put up.”</p>

<p>“Fine young pitchers, both of them,” said his
gentleman friend.</p>

<p>After that the game seesawed along until the
eighth inning, when the score stood 4 to 4. Both
Jack and Tommy Flanders had pitched well, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_271"></a>[271]</span>
the support on each side had been almost flawless.</p>

<p>“Some game, I’ll say,” remarked Fred, as he
came in to the players’ bench. “Why can’t all of
us put up a game like this when we’re at home?”</p>

<p>The only flaw in the proceedings had been when
Flanders had been cautioned by the umpire for
stepping out of the box when about to deliver the
ball.</p>

<p>“You’re mistaken. I didn’t step out,” growled
Flanders, and became quite angry.</p>

<p>“You heard the warning,” was all the umpire
said, but the tone of voice was such that the
Longley pitcher knew he must pay attention to
what was told him.</p>

<p>When the Longley boys came to the bat for the
last time their best stick men were to the front,
and as a result they managed to get in two more
runs, much to their delight.</p>

<p>“Hurrah! Six to four!” cried one of the Longley
boys enthusiastically. “Now then, hold ’em
down to another goose egg and the game is ours!”</p>

<p>“We’ve got to do something, fellows,” said
Gif earnestly. “Who is at the bat?”</p>

<p>“I am,” answered Fred.</p>

<p>“Well, do your best.”</p>

<p>“I certainly will,” responded the stout young
Rover, as he grasped the ashen stick and walked
to the plate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_272"></a>[272]</span></p>

<p>Two balls and a strike were called on Fred.
Then the sphere came in just where he wanted
it. Crack! went the bat, and the ball went sailing
between first and second base. Away flew Fred,
reaching the bag in a cloud of dust.</p>

<p>“Hurrah! A single! Now then, pile up a
few more, fellows!”</p>

<p>Randy was to the bat next, and it must be confessed
that he was just a bit nervous, for he
realized that their chances of winning the game
were slim. Nevertheless, after having a strike
and two balls called upon him, he managed to land
on the horsehide for another single, which took
Fred safely to second.</p>

<p>Spouter now came forward and managed to
dribble the ball down close to first base. He was
put out, but Fred managed to slide to third while
Randy reached second.</p>

<p>The next fellow to the bat was Ned Lowe. He
knocked a pop fly, which the second baseman
gathered in with ease.</p>

<p>“Two out! Now hold ’em down and the game
is ours!”</p>

<p>“Hit it, Jack, hit it for all you’re worth!”
whispered Gif, as Jack came forward with his
bat.</p>

<p>The major of the Colby Hall battalion did not
answer. But he set his teeth and took a firm grip<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_273"></a>[273]</span>
on the ashen stick as he faced Tommy Flanders.
A ball was called and then a strike, and then
another ball and a strike. All those in the grandstand
seemed to hold their breath for what might
be coming. The game might be won or lost in
a few seconds more. Tommy Flanders wound up
with care and the ball came in just a trifle low.
Crack! went the bat, and the horsehide sailed upward
far into the left field.</p>

<p>“Run, boys, run! It’s a two-bagger!”</p>

<p>“No, it isn’t! It’s a home run! Run!”</p>

<p>Fred, playing well off third, came in with ease
and Randy followed almost immediately. Jack
was racing down to second, and as he did this
he saw that the fielder was still running to gather
the bouncing ball. Up he tore to third and there
hesitated for an instant.</p>

<p>“Go in! Go in!” yelled Gif. “You can make
it, Jack! Run! Run!” And with leaps and bounds
Jack came in over the home plate.</p>

<p>“Three runs! Colby Hall wins the game!”</p>

<small>A SQUALL ON THE LAKE</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Of course the Longley boys were keenly disappointed,
especially as they had thought they had
the game “sewed up,” as some of them expressed
it. Yet the contest had been a fair one and they
could not find fault over the result.</p>

<p>“You win,” said Ted Maxwell, coming up and
shaking hands with Gif. “A good clean game.”</p>

<p>“I was a little out of practice,” grumbled Tommy
Flanders. “I bet you couldn’t beat us again,”
and he walked off in disgust.</p>

<p>“Now we’ve had a ball game, why can’t we
have a few races on the lake, or things like that?”
suggested Spouter.</p>

<p>“I’m willing,” put in Bob Mason.</p>

<p>“Maybe we’ll send you a challenge to a boat
race,” added Maxwell.</p>

<p>“All right, anything you say,” returned Gif.</p>

<p>After the ball game matters ran along smoothly
at the bungalow for a week or more. Dan and
the others who were touring left after having had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_275"></a>[275]</span>
“the time of their lives,” as Walt Baxter expressed
it.</p>

<p>There were three rowing matches arranged, a
match between two of the boys from Longley
and two from Colby Hall, then a match for
singles, and finally a match in which the six boys
in the camp were pitted against six of their rivals.</p>

<p>“I hope we manage to do something in those
boat races,” remarked Fred one day, when the
boys were tramping through the woods on another
look for the black bear they had seen.</p>

<p>“Well, I think we’ll have a good chance to
win,” answered Gif. “We won before, didn’t
we?” he went on, with a smile.</p>

<p>“I’ll bet it made them sore to lose that ball
game,” came from Jack.</p>

<p>“We sort of paid ’em back for rough-housing
the bungalow,” remarked Randy.</p>

<p>“Oh, we’ve got to fix ’em for that yet,” said
his brother quickly.</p>

<p>From Mr. Mumbleton the boys had heard that
a black bear had been seen on the lower eastern
shore of the lake and they had rowed over in
that direction.</p>

<p>“I think this is somewhere around the place
where Tommy Flanders’ father bought that factory,”
remarked Gif, after they had come to a
halt to rest for a few minutes. “They said it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_276"></a>[276]</span>
was on Flat Rock Creek, and, unless I’m mistaken,
this is the creek,” and he pointed to a broad and
somewhat muddy watercourse.</p>

<p>“I don’t think we care to visit any factories,”
answered Spouter. “I don’t see why a fellow
should build such a thing up here. It just spoils
the scenery.”</p>

<p>The boys spent the best part of the day in the
woods. They had, as before, brought their lunch
along and rested for nearly an hour after eating
it. Then they concluded that they might as well
go back to where they had left their rowboat and
go home.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter with rowing past the Longley
camp? If we see any of the fellows we can
ask them if they’re all ready for the boat races,”
suggested Fred.</p>

<p>The others were willing, and in a short while
came close to the camp of their rivals. Strange
to say, no one was in sight, not even Jeff.</p>

<p>“Maybe they’ve gotten rid of that darkey already,”
remarked Gif.</p>

<p>“Well, I wouldn’t blame ’em for doing it.”</p>

<p>“Let’s go ashore and take a look around,” suggested
Andy, thinking there might be a chance
to play some trick on the boys who had “rough-housed”
the bungalow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_277"></a>[277]</span></p>

<p>“You want to be careful that they don’t spot
you, Andy,” warned Jack.</p>

<p>They pulled into a little cove under some overhanging
trees and then approached the camp very
cautiously. Not a soul seemed to be about either
of the small bungalows nor at the shed in the
rear, and, growing bolder, the lads entered the
nearest structure.</p>

<p>“Quick! Let’s give ’em a dose of their own
medicine!” exclaimed Andy, and in a twinkling
they were all hard at work disarranging the furniture,
clothing and the bedding and the entire contents
of the kitchen. Then they hurried to the
other bungalow.</p>

<p>“Let’s cart the bedding out into the woods. We
can hang it over some bushes,” suggested Randy,
and this was done with all possible speed.</p>

<p>Then Andy took all the spoons in the place and
jammed them down out of sight into a big pot
of salt. The forks he jammed down into a pot
of sugar.</p>

<p>“I think that’ll keep ’em guessing a little while,”
he chuckled.</p>

<p>Only one boat belonging to the Longley camp
was to be seen, and after surveying the situation
the boys managed to push this under the dock
completely out of sight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_278"></a>[278]</span></p>

<p>“They’ll have to go in swimming to get that
boat out,” said Jack, with a laugh.</p>

<p>Having disarranged the entire camp to their
satisfaction, the boys hurried back to where they
had left their boat and pulled away toward their
own shore.</p>

<p>“Here come a couple of boats now!” cried Jack
presently. “I think they’re the Longley fellows
coming from Rocky Run.”</p>

<p>They kept on rowing and presently the other
boats came close enough to be hailed.</p>

<p>“We’ve been taking your friend Jeff down to
the railroad station,” explained Ted Maxwell.
“We found he was no good—too lazy—so we
shipped him.”</p>

<p>“I don’t blame you, Maxwell!” exclaimed Gif.
“I thought you’d get enough of him before long!”</p>

<p>“How about the races?” called out Jack. “All
ready for them?”</p>

<p>“We’ll be ready when the time comes,”
answered another one of the Longley boys.</p>

<p>“How are you going to keep house without
Jeff?” questioned Andy.</p>

<p>“Oh, we’ll get along all right enough,” replied
Paul Halliday. “We made him put everything in
apple-pie order before he left.”</p>

<p>“And you’ll find it in apple-pie order when you<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_279"></a>[279]</span>
get back—I don’t think,” muttered Randy in a
low tone, and then the boats separated.</p>

<p>“I’d give a dollar to be on hand when they
arrive home,” said Spouter, with a laugh. “Won’t
they be mad?”</p>

<p>“Well, it’s tit for tat,” returned Jack. “They
mustn’t think they can trick us and get away with
it.”</p>

<p>At last came the day for the boat races. The
Rover boys and their chums had practiced constantly
under Gif’s directions and felt that they
had done all they possibly could to win.</p>

<p>“If only the girls were here to see these races,”
remarked Fred.</p>

<p>“Yes. And if only they had been on hand to
see the ball game,” returned Jack. And then his
mind went back to Ruth and to her father and he
wondered how Mr. Stevenson was making out
about the stolen paint-making formulas.</p>

<p>In the singles Fred was victorious over Billy
Sands and Jack came in ahead of Paul Halliday.
In the doubles Spouter and Andy lost to Ted Maxwell
and another of the Longley boys, while Gif
and Randy won with ease over the lad known
as Fiddler and Codfish.</p>

<p>Of course the six-oared race, which took place
three hours later, was the big event. For this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_280"></a>[280]</span>
purpose two boats which were almost alike were
chosen and a course around a number of the
islands was mapped out. Some men in motor-boats
from Beldane were asked to act as judges
and in the end the event took on quite a look of
importance, many coming from all around the
lake to witness the contest.</p>

<p>“Here is where we have got to win!” declared
one of the Longley boys. “It will even up for
losing that ball game.”</p>

<p>“Well, we’re going to win!” cried another, who
was one of the best oarsmen at the academy. “If
you’ll follow my directions we can’t lose.”</p>

<p>For this race both crews had practiced carefully,
and when they came out to the starting line each
looked to be in the pink of condition.</p>

<p>The race proved a great surprise in more ways
than one. The sun was shining, but there were
heavy clouds in the sky and just as the race
started it began to rain. Then the wind blew up
sharply.</p>

<p>“Row, boys, row!” cried Gif, who was setting
the stroke.</p>

<p>“Gee, feel the rain!” murmured Andy. “We’re
in for a ducking.”</p>

<p>“Never mind; pull!” answered Jack.</p>

<p>All had caught the stroke perfectly and were
doing very well. They did not hurry, for the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_281"></a>[281]</span>
course was over two miles and a half long and
they did not wish to tire themselves out before
the finish.</p>

<p>Less than half of the race was over when the
sudden summer storm broke in all its fury. There
was a vivid lightning flash across the sky followed
by a terrific crash of thunder and then came little
less than a deluge, which sent many of the observation
boats to the shore in a hurry.</p>

<p>“Gee, we’re going to catch a squall!” exclaimed
Spouter. And he was right, the heavy gusts of
wind soon sending the whitecaps bobbing up and
down all around them.</p>

<p>“Don’t give up, boys!” shouted Gif, to make
himself heard above the sudden roar of the elements.
“We’ve got to win this race, storm or no
storm.”</p>

<p>“Here come the Longley boys!” exclaimed Jack,
as they were rounding one of the islands. “Great
Scott! did you ever see it blow so hard?”</p>

<p>The squall seemed to grow stronger by the instant,
and the boys had all they could do to keep
the boat from foundering. Nevertheless, they
kept to their oars and soon saw the finishing line
but a short distance ahead. Only the motor-boat
with the judges was nearby, all other craft having
hurried away to seek shelter.</p>

<p>Anxious to win the race, the Longley crew also<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_282"></a>[282]</span>
kept on. But they had swerved somewhat from
their course, and now in trying to regain the
proper position they suddenly shipped a big wave.</p>

<p>“Hi! We can’t stand this!” cried one of the
lads in sudden alarm.</p>

<p>“Pull! Pull!” yelled another. “We’ve got to
win, I tell you! Pull!”</p>

<p>Then came another vivid flash of lightning over
the lake, followed by a deafening clap of thunder.
The shock was so terrific that several of the lads
in the Longley boat were seen to throw up their
hands and let their oars go. Then wind and waves
hit the rowboat a smashing blow on the side and
over it went, hurling the six occupants into the
lake!</p>

<small>AN IMPORTANT DISCOVERY</small></h2>
</div>


<p>The rowboat containing the Colby Hall cadets
had just crossed the finishing line of the race when
the wind and waves hit the Longley craft, turning
it over.</p>

<p>“Hurrah! We win!” shouted Andy, in keen
satisfaction.</p>

<p>“Look! Look!” exclaimed Jack. “The Longley
fellows are in trouble. Their boat has turned
over on them!”</p>

<p>“Gee! we’d better row to the rescue,” came
from Fred, with a gasp. The strenuous rowing
had all but winded him.</p>

<p>In spite of the wind and whitecaps, the six boys
managed to turn the rowboat around and sent it
in the direction of the other craft. They could
see one of the boys clinging to the upturned boat
while the other five were floundering around in
the lake.</p>

<p>The catastrophe was witnessed only by those in
the rowboat and the judges and others aboard the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_284"></a>[284]</span>
motor-boat, for the downfall of rain was now so
heavy it cut out completely the view from the
shore.</p>

<p>The motor-boat started to the rescue also, and
arrived at the scene of the disaster several seconds
ahead of the Colby boys. The motor-boat
people managed to pick up three of the lads in
the lake.</p>

<p>“Save me! Save me!” yelled one of the boys,
and those in the rowboat saw it was Billy Sands.
He was throwing up his arms frantically. Evidently
the race had all but exhausted him.</p>

<p>As the rowboat came closer Jack reached over
and caught Sands by the arm, and then he and
Gif pulled the dripping cadet over the gunwale.
They then rowed up beside Bob Mason and assisted
him aboard.</p>

<p>“My gracious! did you ever see such a storm?”
spluttered Mason. “I never saw so much lightning
in my life. I wish I was ashore.”</p>

<p>“Help! Help! I don’t want to be struck by
lightning!” came in a bellow from the overturned
rowboat, and now the Colby Hall boys saw that
the fellow clutching the craft was Tommy
Flanders.</p>

<p>Another flash of lightning now lit up the scene
and the thunder rolled along from one end of the
lake to the other. In the midst of this those on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_285"></a>[285]</span>
the motor-boat hauled in Flanders and then came
beside the craft occupied by the Colby Hall cadets
and those they had rescued.</p>

<p>“Shall we pull you in?” questioned the man who
had the motor-boat in charge.</p>

<p>“Perhaps it would be as well,” answered Gif.
“We’re pretty well tired out from the race, and
that wind is fierce.”</p>

<p>“All right. We’ll take you over to your dock.
Here’s a rope. Tie it fast.”</p>

<p>“What of our boat?” questioned Ted Maxwell.</p>

<p>“We can either pick that up coming back or let
it drift. I don’t think you’ll lose it.”</p>

<p>Some floating oars were picked up and then the
craft belonging to Mr. Garrison was hauled over
to its dock.</p>

<p>“Well, you fellows win the race,” said the judge
of the contest, with a smile. “Some finish, I’ll
say.”</p>

<p>“Won’t all of you come into the bungalow?”
asked Gif politely. “No use of starting out in
this terrible downpour. It will probably let up in
a little while.”</p>

<p>“I think we might as well,” said one of the
men present, and everybody marched into the
bungalow. Here fire was started, both in the
living room and in the kitchen, so that those who
wished to do so might dry themselves. Then several<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_286"></a>[286]</span>
pots of hot coffee were made and passed
around.</p>

<p>“That touches the spot!” said Ted Maxwell
gratefully. “I was quite chilled by that sudden
bath after being all overheated from the race.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want any coffee,” grumbled Tommy
Flanders. “I want to get back to our camp.” He
had determined to make himself as disagreeable
as possible.</p>

<p>“We’ll take you over there as soon as the storm
lets up a little,” said the man who had the motor-boat
in charge.</p>

<p>“It was a mighty nice thing for you fellows to
do—to go to our rescue,” remarked Bob Mason to
Gif and Jack. “I’ll not forget it. I’m sorry now
that we came over here the other day and mussed
things up.”</p>

<p>“Well, I guess you got paid back for that,” put
in Andy.</p>

<p>“We sure did,” replied Mason, with a grin.
And then he added in a whisper: “Several of our
fellows wanted to destroy your stuff, but Maxwell
and I wouldn’t stand for that.”</p>

<p>The sudden summer storm stopped as quickly
as it had begun, and before long the motor-boat
departed, carrying the Longley boys to their own
side of the lake. On the way the overturned rowboat<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_287"></a>[287]</span>
was picked up and also another one of the
floating oars.</p>

<p>After the races the Rover boys and their chums
settled down to enjoy themselves thoroughly.
They felt that in the future the Longley boys
would leave them alone so far as “rough-housing”
the place was concerned.</p>

<p>The six lads were still anxious to get on the
trail of the bear they had seen, and went out several
times, but without success.</p>

<p>“We must have scared Mr. Bear out of his
wits,” said Jack. “Otherwise we’d find some
trace of him.”</p>

<p>“Oh, let’s try it again!” cried Fred. And
eagerly they set out one Monday morning after a
quiet Sunday in and around the bungalow.</p>

<p>They started in the rowboat, going again to the
eastern shore of the lake in the vicinity of Flat
Rock Creek, for Mose Mumbleton had again told
them that the bear had surely been seen somewhere
in that vicinity.</p>

<p>“Maybe it’s a different bear from the one we
saw on our side of the lake,” remarked Spouter.</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t care if it is,” answered Fred.
“One bear is as good as another as far as I am
concerned if only we can bring him down.”</p>

<p>The boys tramped around the best part of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_288"></a>[288]</span>
morning and then sat down to rest in the shade of
some trees and bushes while partaking of the
lunch they had brought along. They were close
to a footpath running along the edge of the creek
that flowed into Big Bear Lake, and while resting
after eating saw two men coming along the path
talking earnestly.</p>

<p>“I won’t take a cent less than five thousand
dollars,” one of the men was saying. “Flanders
has got to pay that much or he don’t get the
formulas.”</p>

<p>“If I had my say, Carl, I’d charge him more
than five thousand,” said the second man, a tall,
thin individual with a heavy moustache.</p>

<p>“Well, five thousand is quite a sum, Tex,” answered
the fellow called Carl, who spoke with
something of a German accent. Then the two
men left the vicinity of the creek and took to a
trail leading through the woods.</p>

<p>The six boys had heard every word spoken, and
they gazed at each other in surprise.</p>

<p>“They’re going to try to sell Flanders something
for five thousand dollars!” observed Gif.</p>

<p>“Did you hear the names Carl and Tex?” ejaculated
Jack. “Those fellows must be Carl Lemrech
and Tex Norris, the fellows suspected of
stealing that book of formulas!”</p>

<p>“Exactly!” cried Randy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_289"></a>[289]</span></p>

<p>“I wonder if they’ve got the book of formulas
with ’em,” came from Fred.</p>

<p>“Let’s follow them,” put in Andy, in excitement.</p>

<p>“We will, Andy,” answered Jack readily. “But
listen! Perhaps it will be as well if we keep out
of sight.”</p>

<p>With caution the six lads followed the two men
through the woods until they reached an old cabin
which had long since seen its best days. They
found the men inside smoking and drinking from
a flask one carried. They were talking earnestly.</p>

<p>“This is Monday,” said Lemrech. “I’ll fix it
so we can see Flanders here by Wednesday noon.
We’ll leave the book of formulas hidden right
where it is and he sha’n’t have a sight of it until
he shows us his money. I wouldn’t trust him to
pay up if he had the book. He knows well
enough we couldn’t sue him.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, you want to get your money first,”
answered Tex Norris.</p>

<p>After this the men talked the matter over for a
quarter of an hour longer. Then there came a
hail from the distance.</p>

<p>“There’s that farmer who said he might give
us board,” remarked Lemrech. “Come ahead.”</p>

<p>“We don’t want to fix up the deal with Flanders
at a boarding house,” complained Norris.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_290"></a>[290]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, no. We’ll fix it up right here. And I’ll
make the time Wednesday noon sharp.”</p>

<p>“What do you think we ought to do, Jack?”
questioned Fred, when the two men had departed.</p>

<p>“Don’t you think we ought to search the cabin
and see if that book of formulas is anywhere
around?” questioned Andy.</p>

<p>“We might do that. But the chances are the
men have hidden the book where we couldn’t very
well find it. I think the best thing we can do is
to hurry to Beldane and send Mr. Stevenson a
telegram to come at once.”</p>

<p>The boys knew they could not telegraph from
Rocky Run, as no regular office was located there.
They hurried down to the lake and set off for
Beldane without delay.</p>

<p>“I’ll bet Mr. Stevenson will be surprised when
he gets our message,” said Jack, after the yellow
slip had been passed in and paid for at the Beldane
telegraph office.</p>

<p>“Going to wait for a reply?” questioned Gif.</p>

<p>“I think we might as well.”</p>

<p>The boys hung around for three hours. Then
came a message from Mr. Stevenson. It was to
the effect that he would start for Big Bear Lake
on the first train in the morning.</p>

<small>JEFF BRINGS NEWS</small></h2>
</div>


<p>The Rover boys and their chums knew that
Mr. Stevenson could not arrive at the camp before
Tuesday evening. He would take the train to
Beldane and would probably come up to the bungalow
in a motor-boat. After breakfast on Tuesday
time hung heavily with all of the lads. They took
their morning bath and then knew hardly what to
do, being somewhat excited over the prospect
ahead.</p>

<p>“Maybe Mr. Stevenson will have a regular fight
to get that book of formulas back,” was Randy’s
comment.</p>

<p>“When he goes after those men and after Mr.
Flanders he’d better go armed,” said Fred.</p>

<p>“I intend to go with him if he’ll let me,” put in
Jack.</p>

<p>“I guess we’d all like to go along,” said Gif,
with a laugh.</p>

<p>Not knowing what else to be at, Andy and
Randy took a walk up the brook back of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_292"></a>[292]</span>
bungalow. They were gone about half an hour
when they came rushing back wild with excitement.</p>

<p>“We saw the bear!” gasped Andy, who was all
but winded from running.</p>

<p>“He’s stretched out on some rocks sunning himself!”
put in his brother.</p>

<p>“The bear! Where is he? Let’s get a shot at
him!” exclaimed Fred, and, leaping up, ran for
his gun.</p>

<p>All of the others did likewise, and in less than
a minute the six campers, fully armed, were
moving cautiously up the brook in the direction
where the twins had said the bear had been
located.</p>

<p>“We don’t want to make any noise,” whispered
Jack.</p>

<p>“Is everybody’s gun in good condition?” questioned
Gif, in an equally low tone. “We can’t
take any chances, you know; that bear may be a
real fighter when he’s aroused.”</p>

<p>At this each of the lads examined his weapon,
to find it in good order and ready for use. They
moved forward in a bunch, each straining his eyes
to be the first to catch sight of bruin.</p>

<p>“Now take it easy,” said Randy presently.
“Those rocks where we saw the bear are not over
a hundred yards away.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_293"></a>[293]</span></p>

<p>“Come on! Let us circle a little to the south,”
cautioned Jack. “We don’t want the wind to
carry our scent. Some of those bears have a nose
as keen as a deer, so I’ve been told.”</p>

<p>As they advanced between the trees and around
the rocks and brushwood the six lads carried their
guns ready for instant use. If the truth must be
told, each was anxious to get the first shot at the
game.</p>

<p>“There he is!”</p>

<p>“He’s coming this way!”</p>

<p>“Shoot him!”</p>

<p><a href="#i_frontis">Bang! Crack! Bang! went the</a> shot<a href="#i_frontis">guns</a> and
light rifles <a href="#i_frontis">the boys carried</a>, and the black bear,
suddenly leaping from some rough rocks just
ahead of them, was shot in the foreshoulder and
in the rump. The beast emitted a loud roar, and
then suddenly disappeared behind some nearby
brushwood.</p>

<p>“Where’d he go?”</p>

<p>“Look out! He may jump out at you!”</p>

<p>Reloading hastily, the six lads circled the brushwood
cautiously, each straining for another sight
of the black bear. They could hear a low growl
and saw some of the bushes suddenly move.</p>

<p>“Give him another dose just for luck,” suggested
Gif, and the six firearms sounded almost<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_294"></a>[294]</span>
as one as all the lads fired at the spot where they
thought the black bear might be.</p>

<p>How many of the shots reached the mark they
were never to ascertain. But evidently the bear
was hit again, and with a fearful roar of rage and
pain it suddenly burst from the brushwood and
lumbered in the direction where Fred and Spouter
were standing.</p>

<p>“Shoot him! Shoot him quick!”</p>

<p>Crack! went Jack’s rifle and bang! came a report
from the shotgun Gif carried. Then one after
another the other weapons rang out and the black
bear was halted when less than three yards away
from Fred and Spouter. The huge creature, now
on its hind legs, tottered from side to side and
then came down with a crash at the foot of a big
tree.</p>

<p>“Hurrah! We’ve got him!” cried Randy.</p>

<p>“Be careful! Maybe we’ll have to give him a
shot or two more,” cautioned Jack.</p>

<p>The young major was right. The bear, a tough
old fellow, was by no means dead. Though seriously
wounded, it thrashed around and then did
its best to stand up.</p>

<p>“I’m going to finish him,” cried Fred, and before
any one could stop the stout young Rover, he
had run forward and sent a charge of buckshot<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_295"></a>[295]</span>
directly into the bear’s ear. At once the huge
creature rolled over on its back, gave a few spasmodic
jerks, and then lay still.</p>

<p>For a moment after the end came the boys could
scarcely understand what had happened. Then,
as they realized that they had laid the big black
bear low, their faces broke out into smiles and they
shook each other by the hand.</p>

<p>“We got him! We got him!” exulted Fred,
dancing around. “And look at the size of him!”</p>

<p>“Some bear rug there, I’ll say,” was Randy’s
comment.</p>

<p>“No bare floor with a bear rug like that,”
chuckled Andy, who even in such a moment of excitement
had to have his little joke.</p>

<p>“Now the question is, how are we going to get
this bear down to camp?” said Gif, after they had
made certain the creature was dead.</p>

<p>“We might as well skin it right here,” suggested
Spouter. “No need of carting the whole carcass
along. Why, it must weigh five or six hundred
pounds!”</p>

<p>“We’ve got to have a picture of him,” cried
Fred. And several snap shots were taken without
delay.</p>

<p>“We want some bear steaks for supper,” said
Jack. “We’ll treat Mr. Stevenson to a surprise.”</p>

<p>“Why can’t we roll the bear over to the brook<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_296"></a>[296]</span>
and float him down somehow,” suggested Gif.
And after a good deal of labor this was done and
they managed to bring the carcass to a point some
distance behind the bungalow. Here they skinned
the bear and cut out the choicest of the meat, chopping
up the remainder and dragging it off so that
the smell might not reach camp.</p>

<p>Fred and Spouter were trying their hand at
broiling some bear steaks when they heard a shout
from the other lads. Thinking that Mr. Stevenson
had arrived, they ran to the front of the
bungalow, to behold a rowboat coming in containing
a single occupant.</p>

<p>“It’s Jeff come back! What do you know
about that?” cried Gif, in disgust.</p>

<p>“I suppose he’d like you to give him another
trial, Gif,” said Jack.</p>

<p>“Not unless he promises to do much better than
he did,” was Gif’s reply.</p>

<p>“Well, to have somebody to do the cooking and
dishwashing would help out a whole lot,” said
Spouter, with a sigh. Secretly he and the others
were all tired of doing the housework.</p>

<p>“Good afternoon, gen’leman,” said Jeff, as he
bowed politely to the six boys. “Kind o’ surprised
to see me, I suppose?”</p>

<p>“We certainly are, Jeff,” answered Gif.</p>

<p>“I’s got a few days’ work with Mr. Mumbleton,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_297"></a>[297]</span>
cleanin’ up around his store and warehouse
and doin’ odd jobs at the boathouse,” explained
the colored man.</p>

<p>“I see,” answered Gif briefly.</p>

<p>“Thought maybe you might be tired of doin’
the work ’round the house,” went on Jeff uneasily.
“Wouldn’t you like me to cook a first-class dinner
for you? I’m jest achin’ to do it.”</p>

<p>“It’s only your confounded laziness, Jeff, that
made us send you off,” answered Gif. “If you
could get over that you’d be all right.”</p>

<p>“It wasn’t laziness, Mr. Gif. ’Twas the misery
in my back. But that misery is done gone
now, and I don’t think it’ll come back. And besides,
I come here to tell you somethin’,” went
on the colored man earnestly. “I wants to tell
you somethin’ about some of them boys over to
that camp yonder,” and he pointed to the eastern
shore of the lake.</p>

<p>“What have you got to tell us, Jeff?” questioned
Randy.</p>

<p>“I thought it might be of importance to you
young gen’lemen. It’s about somethin’ that happened
at Colby Hall while you was there. But
say, Mr. Gif, how about it? Don’t you want me
to get supper ready and clean up around the
place?” questioned the colored man eagerly. “I
don’t like it nohow down to that Mr. Mumbleton’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_298"></a>[298]</span>
store. I’d ruther be workin’ for real quality
people.”</p>

<p>“Well, we might give you another trial, Jeff,”
answered Gif, after a glance at his chums. “But
remember, you’ve got to be right on the job.
No more going to sleep and letting a good dinner
burn up.”</p>

<p>“No, sir! No, sir! Nothin’ like that no
more. That misery in my back is gone, and
you’ll find me wide awake,” answered Jeff
earnestly.</p>

<p>“Now what have you got to tell us about those
fellows over in the other camp?” asked Spouter,
impatiently.</p>

<p>“It’s about a fire what done took place at the
Colby Hall boathouse,” answered Jeff, much to
the astonishment of all the lads.</p>

</div>


<p>“What do you know about that fire?” questioned
Jack.</p>

<p>“That fire was sot by three of them Longley
boys,” answered Jeff. “I done heard them
talkin’ about it one night.”</p>

<p>“You did!” exclaimed Fred. “Who were the
boys?”</p>

<p>“They was that Flanders boy and them two
other fellows named Sands and Halliday.”</p>

<p>“Tell us all about this, Jeff!” cried Andy
eagerly.</p>

<p>Thereupon, sitting on the bungalow porch with
the boys around him, the colored man gave the
particulars. He said that he had caught the three
boys behind the shed at the Willoughby camp
smoking and playing cards. They were talking
about old times and did not notice him when he
went into the shed. He heard them mention a
fire at the Colby Hall boathouse and, listening,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_300"></a>[300]</span>
found that it had been caused by Flanders and his
two cronies.</p>

<p>“I ain’t sure that they done it on purpose,”
went on Jeff. “They went there to rough-house
the place, same as when they done come here and
rough-housed this bungalow. They had a lantern
with ’em, and Sands said the lantern got
knocked over accidental like. But Flanders
didn’t act much like it was accidental like and
Halliday didn’t neither.”</p>

<p>“I guess if it was accidental they were glad it
happened,” cried Jack. “And one thing is certain,
they didn’t try to put out the fire. They
just skipped out and let the place take care of
itself.”</p>

<p>“We ought to let Colonel Colby know about
this,” said Spouter. “It’s too serious a matter
to let go by. Of course, we could accuse Flanders
and those other fellows, but what good
would it do us?”</p>

<p>“Let’s put it all down in writing and get Jeff
to sign it,” suggested Gif.</p>

<p>This was agreed upon, and the boys lost no
time in taking down the colored man’s statement.
Then they read it to him and he signed it, and
they put their names on the paper as witnesses
to the signature. Then Jeff shuffled off into the
kitchen of the bungalow to get ready for supper.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_301"></a>[301]</span></p>

<p>“I’ll surprise you young gen’lemen, you see if
I don’t,” said the colored man. “And I’ll surprise
that Mr. Stevenson, too.”</p>

<p>“All right, Jeff,” said Gif, “you can remain
here just as long as you make good. The minute
you fail in your duties you’ll have to
leave.”</p>

<p>It was growing dark when the boys heard the
put-put of a motor-boat coming from the lake,
and soon the craft rounded a point of the shore
and glided up to the bungalow dock.</p>

<p>“Hello, Mr. Stevenson! Glad to see you!”
cried Jack, as he ran down to the dock.</p>

<p>“And I’m glad to get here,” answered Ruth’s
father, as he leaped from the boat and shook
hands. “Great news you fellows sent me.”</p>

<p>“I certainly hope it proves all right,” returned
the young major.</p>

<p>“I’m impatient to learn the details,” continued
Frederic Stevenson. And then he went on:
“How about it, Gif? Can you take care of the
man who has the motor-boat? I thought we
might be able to use that craft in getting around
the lake.”</p>

<p>“Sure, we can,” answered Gif readily. “There
are empty rooms galore in this place and we have
plenty on hand to eat. We can give you a real
treat to-night. We have some bear steaks.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_302"></a>[302]</span></p>

<p>“Good gracious! did you shoot a bear?” came
from the man who ran the motor-boat.</p>

<p>“We sure did!” answered Fred proudly, while
the others were shaking hands with the new arrival.
“A great big black bear! And we got
a wildcat, too!” he continued.</p>

<p>While Jeff was preparing supper the boys gave
Ruth’s father the particulars of the interview
they had overheard at the old cabin on the other
side of Big Bear Lake. Of course, the gentleman
was tremendously interested and listened to
every word with close attention.</p>

<p>“I believe you’ve solved the mystery of that
disappearance,” said he, after they had finished.
“Now the only thing to do is to get hold of that
book of formulas.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you want to catch Mr. Flanders when
he tries to buy the book from those rascals?”
asked Spouter. “It seems to me a man who
would be mean enough to do that ought to be
exposed.”</p>

<p>“It’s just possible that Mr. Flanders may be
innocent in the matter,” suggested Mr. Stevenson.
“The other men may claim that they
brought the book of formulas from Germany
direct and that they have a right to it. However,
it won’t do any harm to listen to what the
men have to say when Flanders appears.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_303"></a>[303]</span></p>

<p>During the evening the boys related what had
taken place during their outing at Big Bear Lake
and in return Mr. Stevenson told them something
of what Ruth and the other girls had been doing,
and of how matters were going with himself and
Uncle Barney.</p>

<p>“If I can only get hold of that book of formulas
I’ll be all right,” said the gentleman. “Otherwise
everything will be at sixes and sevens.”</p>

<p>It was an impatient crowd that went to bed
that night, and they were equally impatient after
breakfast in the morning, all wanting to see how
the affair concerning the book of formulas would
terminate. It was not until about ten o’clock that
they started for the other side of the lake. They
landed at the spot where the boys had been two
days before and, leaving the boatman behind, followed
the same trail leading to the cabin in the
woods.</p>

<p>“Now I suppose we had better hide,” said Mr.
Stevenson. “If those men catch sight of us they
may run away and we may never be able to catch
them.”</p>

<p>With great care they concealed themselves behind
some brushwood and there waited for a long
time in silence. Some of the boys were just
about thinking that the men would never come
when they heard voices in the distance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_304"></a>[304]</span></p>

<p>“Here they are, I think,” whispered Gif. And
then Mr. Stevenson put his finger over his lips
and all became silent.</p>

<p>Peering through the brushwood, Jack saw that
two of the men were Carl Lemrech and Tex
Norris. The third individual was short and
stocky and his face bore a strong resemblance to
that of Tommy Flanders.</p>

<p>“Oh, you needn’t be disturbed, Flanders,” said
Carl Lemrech, in his German accent. “We got
the goods. It’s the same book that was sold to
that man Stevenson.”</p>

<p>“You’d better not mention names around here,
Lemrech,” grumbled Mr. Flanders.</p>

<p>“Oh, this is a very lonely place. Nobody ever
comes here,” put in Tex Norris.</p>

<p>Thus talking, the three men entered the cabin,
leaving the door, however, wide open. There
were two windows on one side of the building,
and these were open also.</p>

<p>“I’m going forward to investigate,” whispered
Mr. Stevenson. “If I give the signal, jump out
and point your guns at them. I don’t want any
of them to get away.”</p>

<p>“Gee, this is getting real exciting!” murmured
Randy. All the boys had brought their weapons
with them, but more for a show of arms than for
any thought of actually using them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_305"></a>[305]</span></p>

<p>Mr. Stevenson crawled up toward one of the
open windows and Jack and Fred could not resist
the temptation to crawl up to the other. The
three heard the men inside talking earnestly.
Lemrech had made a demand for five thousand
dollars and Flanders tried to cut this amount in
half.</p>

<p>“No, sir, it’s five thousand dollars or nothing,”
growled Lemrech. “Isn’t that so, Tex?”</p>

<p>“It sure is! Five thousand!” answered
Norris. “And we want it in cold cash, too! No
checks or anything like that!”</p>

<p>“How do you know I’ve got so much cash with
me?” demanded Tommy Flanders’ father.</p>

<p>“Well, I told you to bring cash,” answered
Carl Lemrech.</p>

<p>“Let me see the book, so that I know it’s all
right,” answered Flanders.</p>

<p>“You’ll pay the five thousand in cash?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>Carl Lemrech paused for a moment and then,
going to a corner of the cabin, removed a couple
of boards in the flooring. From an opening below
he took a heavy tin box. This he unlocked
and brought forth a package wrapped in a newspaper.</p>

<p>“Here’s the book,” he said, as he unwrapped
the package. “And I want to tell you, Flanders,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_306"></a>[306]</span>
it contains the best formulas for making artists’
paints that I ever heard of. You ought to make
a fortune out of these formulas. You can manufacture
those paints for artists in that old factory
up on Flat Rock Creek and very few people will
be the wiser. You can capture the market with
that sort of artists’ material.”</p>

<p>The book was passed over to Flanders and he
began to study it carefully.</p>

<p>“Seems to be all right,” he said slowly. “Of
course, I don’t— Hello! what’s that? Give me
that book!”</p>

<p>Flanders broke off abruptly, for while he had
been looking into the book of formulas it had
suddenly been snatched from his grasp. Turning,
he found himself confronted by Mr. Stevenson.</p>

<p>“This book is mine, Mr. Flanders,” said Ruth’s
father coolly.</p>

<p>“Stevenson!” muttered Carl Lemrech, and
turned pale.</p>

<p>“A fine piece of business you’re in,” went on
Frederic Stevenson. “About to buy a book of
formulas that was stolen by those men from me!”</p>

<p>“Jump him! Get the book away from him!”
yelled Tex Norris, and made a leap forward.</p>

<p>But Frederic Stevenson had anticipated such a
move, and as Norris came on he backed out of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_307"></a>[307]</span>
the doorway, stuffing the book of formulas into
his pocket.</p>

<p>“Up with your hands, every one of you!” he
called sternly, as he produced a pistol. Then,
turning to the boys, he added: “Don’t let any
of them get away.”</p>

<p>All of those in the cabin had come to the doorway,
and now they gazed around in bewilderment
to find six young fellows in sight and each armed
with either a shotgun or a rifle.</p>

<p>“I guess you understand the game is up,” said
Mr. Stevenson quietly. “All those young men
attend Colby Hall Military Academy and they all
know how to shoot. You’ll be safer if you keep
your hands up,” and thereupon every hand in the
cabin doorway was elevated.</p>

<p>It had been a quick victory, and now that it
was over Mr. Stevenson and the boys hardly
knew what to do with the three men. In the end,
however, each of them was searched and disarmed,
and then each had to submit to having his
hands bound behind him. In this fashion all
were marched down to the lakeshore and made
to step into the motor-boat.</p>

<p>“See here, Stevenson, let us settle this matter,”
said Mr. Flanders eagerly. “It’s all a mistake,
I tell you. These fellows said you were trying
to do them out of something that rightfully belonged<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_308"></a>[308]</span>
to them. I’ll give you a thousand dollars
to drop the whole matter.”</p>

<p>“Nothing doing, Flanders,” answered Mr.
Stevenson briefly. “You can tell your story to
the officers of the law.”</p>

<p>The three men were taken to Beldane where a
complaint was lodged by Ruth’s father. Then
Lemrech and Norris were placed in jail, Flanders
being let out on bail.</p>

<p>It may be mentioned here that later on Lemrech
and Norris were tried for the theft of the
book of formulas and each received a long term
in prison. Then Tommy Flanders’ father was
tried for his part in the transaction, and it was
only by the shrewdness of his lawyers that he
finally managed to escape imprisonment. As it
was, many felt that he was guilty and refused
after that to have anything to do with him.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile, Colonel Colby took up the
matter concerning the burning of the boathouse.
Tommy Flanders, as well as Paul Halliday and
Billy Sands, were terror stricken when confronted
with the evidence against them. They, however,
insisted that the fire had been an accidental one—that
they had simply come to the place to “rough-house”
it and perhaps to damage some of the
shells. When the lantern had been broken and
the scattered oil had blazed up, they had become<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_309"></a>[309]</span>
frightened and run away. Their parents paid
for all the damage that had been done and there
the matter rested. None of the three boys returned
to the camp on Big Bear Lake, and Maxwell,
Mason and a number of the others were
glad to get rid of them.</p>

<p>“They are altogether too rough for our crowd,”
was Ted Maxwell’s comment. “I wish they
would leave Longley Academy.”</p>

<p>After the excitement attending the capture of
the three men and the exposure of Tommy Flanders
and his cronies the Rover boys and their
chums put in several weeks more boating and
fishing, as well as hunting. They brought down
another wildcat, and Randy had the satisfaction
of bringing in the biggest fish ever caught in the
lake.</p>

<p>“Some adventures we’re having,” declared
Jack. But still more stirring times were in store
for the boys, and what some of them were will
be related in another volume, to be called, “The
Rover Boys Shipwrecked; Or, A Thrilling Hunt
for Pirates’ Gold.”</p>

<p>During those days Jack got another letter from
Ruth in which she said she was very thankful
that matters were being straightened out for her
father and her Uncle Barney.</p>

<p>Then one day came a surprise for the boys.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_310"></a>[310]</span>
Two motor-boats came in from Beldane and on
them were all the girls, accompanied by Mrs.
Stevenson, Mrs. Dick Rover, and Mr. and Mrs.
Garrison.</p>

<p>“We’ve come to stay a week!” cried Martha
Rover.</p>

<p>“And we expect you to entertain us royally,”
came from her cousin Mary.</p>

<p>“We’ll do that, all right enough,” answered
Jack quickly, and with his eyes full on Ruth.</p>

<p>“We’ll give you the best times ever!” exclaimed
Fred.</p>

<p>“When you go away you’ll say Big Bear Lake
is as nice a spot as you ever visited,” put in Randy.</p>

<p>“And you’ll want to come here every year,”
finished his twin.</p>

<p>And here while the Rover boys and their
chums are getting ready to give the girls a glorious
time, we will say good-by.</p>

1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
